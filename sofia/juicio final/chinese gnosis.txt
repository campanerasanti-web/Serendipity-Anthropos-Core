### Preface

In 1823 the first translation into a Western language of Lao
Tzu's Tao Te Ching was published by the French author, Abel
Remusat. He made this ancient Chinese text known to the
Western world, and since then, an almost unending stream of
translations and commentaries have been produced in attempts
to make its brief but very profound contents intelligible for
Western people.
Nevertheless, as far as we know, there has never been a
commentary on the Tao Te Ching like the one you are now
about to read, in which the Tao Te Ching is seen as a gnostic
text and is interpreted on the basis of gnostic insight. This
explains the title of the book _The Chinese Gnosis._
What is Gnosis In one of their earlier works, _The Universal
Gnosis,_ the authors describe it as follows `Originally, the
Gnosis was the sum and substance of the ancient wisdom, the
compendium of all knowledge having a direct relation to the
original divine life of a truly unearthly divine human life-wave.
The Hierophants of the Gnosis were, and still are, the
messengers of the Immovable Kingdom. They convey the
divine wisdom to lost humankind and point out the way to
those who, as prodigal sons, want to return to the original land
of the Father.'
This description makes it clear that, contrary to what people
often say these days, true Gnosis — the original divine
Knowledge which gives access to the path of liberation — is
never limited to one particular country or nation. Gnosis is
universal and intended for the whole human race, and wherever
in the world the Messengers of the Light may work, it

PREFACE
```
will always be revealed. That is why it was manifested not
only in the Middle East, but also in ancient China, in the form
of the _Tao Te Ching,_ a book still treated with veneration in
China today. The wisdom set down in the Tao Te Ching is
every bit as relevant now as it was in Lao Tzu's time. Take
this verse from chapter 31, for instance

_The finest weapons are instruments of disaster.
Those who possess Tao will have nothing to do with them._

Or this verse, from chapter 33

_He who overcomes others is strong, but
he who overcomes himself is omnipotent._

The authors' interpretation of this verse is as follows `being
omnipotent means unlocking and participating in the core
essence, the nuclear power, of the Godhead'. In a few simple
words, this summarises the whole, magnificent task underlying
human existence.
_The Chinese Gnosis_ not only explains this task, but also
shows how it can be accomplished. Then, say the authors, `we
will see the whole world, the whole of humankind and the
whole of our society change'.

_Those who from delusion's grasp break free,
find the path to inner reality.
Those who unto not-doing attain, are
linked as one, forever, in the Chain._

### Introduction

### The sublime wisdom of Lao Tzu

If you are a student of esoteric literature, you may have read
about a remarkable mystery involving the medieval inhabi-
tants of the South of France. There, in the land of Sabartez,
the cradle of the Cathars — praised be their name! — a super-
natural power was possessed, the power of the _consolamen-
tum._ By means of the consolamentum it was possible to bring
about a separation between animal-man and spirit-man, be-
tween the human being of this earth and the original being, in
the form it possessed before time began.
The consolamentum was more than a sacramental seal. It
was more than simply a magical outpouring of power,
because for the Cathars it involved a definitive break with
dialectical life. So those who had received the consolamen-
tum were no longer inhabitants of the earth in the absolute
sense. In the true sense of the words, they were _in_ the world,
but no longer _of_ the world.
Researchers have often wondered about the identity of the
spiritual instigators behind this movement in medieval France.
They could see quite clearly that this spiritual awakening, if it
could have evolved without interference, would have
embraced the whole of Europe in a way hitherto unknown.
Who were the initiates who inspired the movement, and had
such an effect on tens of thousands of people, that the church
turned against them with a bloody and terrible hatred
These initiates were world-citizens in the best sense of the
word, who literally loved the whole of humankind and who
even now move and appear among us, wherever an opportunity
presents itself. Their traces are to be found from east to

west, and from north to south. And if one studies world history,
one can detect the connections between all the various events
and developments they have brought about.
Even so, from earliest times until the present, they have
always remained in the background, cloaked in mystery. There
is a hermetic veil between them and the masses, and all
attempts of self-willed science to trace the source of the mys-
tery must and will always fail.
For the knowledge, the art and the abilities of the Cathars
were universal. Their source was not to be found on earth, but
only in the Immovable Kingdom itself.
There are authors who deplore the destruction — or rather
the apparent destruction — of the Cathars, and lament the loss
of their wisdom and power. But this sorrow is misplaced,
because any power, any sublime wisdom whose origin is the
universal life itself, can never be lost. It is nothing less than
the breath of God, which passes over human beings time and
time again in its loving efforts to save them, withdrawing
again whenever, in their hatred and blood-lust, material and
mortal human beings attempt to violate it.

We wanted to consider this European contact with the uni-
versal power of love as a prelude to our reflections on a simi-
lar divine contact that took place in the Far East — a contact
embodied in the sublime being known as Lao Tzu.
It is not known whether he really lived, or whether he was
one person or several. Countless legends surround him like a
veil. But one thing is certain — that he, in his wisdom, could
have dispelled all the sorrow of the observers and researchers
of that medieval drama in the South of France. Because the
mystery of the consolamentum can also be referred to as the
mystery of _Tao._


### Introduction

```
Tao comes not and was not; Tao is! But, says Lao Tzu
```
```
People old in experience, who knew Tao
Did not speak of this most secret sanctuary,
Well-knowing that the profane incline towards
darkness,
Converting powers of life into destruction.
```
```
If certain powers awaken in the human being
And he becomes conscious of his great strength
Without breaking away from his lower self-seeking,
The fire smothers in its own cinders.
```
```
So do not reveal the mystery to the profane;
Is not the naked eye blinded by too much light
To govern a nation means to fulfil a great task
That of giving light whilst standing in the
shadow.
```
It is said that the Cathars possessed secret books expoun-
ding the true life and the Universal Doctrine, which were
destroyed by the priesthood of those times. However, the
true hidden book of the Cathars is the unwritten book, the
same as the book of Tao, and the book `M' of Christian
Rosycross, and the book sealed with seven seals
mentioned in the Revelation of John. This book, this uni-
versal knowledge, is unwritten and hidden from the pro-
fane. But it is open, and revealed in fiery, radiant letters,
to those who have broken away from their lower self-
seeking.

 The quotations used in this chapter are translated from the Dutch _Teh,
universele bewustwording, 319 parafrasen op de Tao Teh King van Lao Tse,_
by C. van Dijk, Amsterdam, 1934.


INTRODUCTION
That is why, for the Cathars, the consolamentum was pre-
ceded by the _endure._ The endura is a `dying as to nature'; it
means freeing oneself of the I-being and making oneself ready
for rebirth.
To the extent that you, too, are engaged in this process, you
no longer need to waste time and energy searching for books
and manuscripts on which you pin all your hopes of liberation.
Tao can neither be spoken nor written. Tao, the way, the path,
can only be _experienced._
This single sentence reveals the poverty of intellectual
knowledge and understanding and the foolishness of the
brain-consciousness, in all their nakedness. You can only
know anything worth knowing, you can only possess any-
thing worth possessing, you can only understand anything
worth understanding, when you have died as to nature, when
the so deadly I-delusion has been extinguished from your
microcosm. Until you begin this process, you will remain
profane, godless, immature, staring into the darkness of your
reason and possessing nothing, nothing at all.
What you will have, however, is the sorrow, the searing
woe of life in dialectics, a terrible, raging fire that is repeat-
edly smothered in its own cinders, only to blaze up yet again.
To remain subject to dialectics means to be consumed by a
hellish pain without end, from which you can only obtain
freedom by following the path, the way, Tao. You need to
pass through the endura, through the self-neutralisation of the
lower nature.
But you cannot do it alone, and neither do you need to,
because the power you need to help you really does exist! And
the liberating words really are there to be heard! If only you
will leave behind everything you possess, then, like Lao Tzu,
you will see


```
INTRODUCTION
The hidden power, 0 mystery, inviolate eternally,
0 clear and tranquil fountain, true life's source
In deepest essence, are we truly one with you;
For, from the One, the multitude flows forth.
```
Many pupils of the Spiritual School seem unable to see this one,
true life, this one essential thing, even though they are searching
and yearning for it.
This must have a reason, and it can only lie in the fact that
many are still clinging too tightly to the things of the old life,
and expect divine revelation simply to penetrate the inner-
most parts of their earthly being and awaken the one true life
within their microcosms, without their needing to follow any
process.
But that is not so! If you want to travel to the new, pro-
mised land, you yourself will have to cast off the many heavy
anchors you have driven into the shores of your life. And the
fact that this is possible is confirmed by the holy language,
which says `He that calls you is nearby.' Yes, even nearer
than hands and feet. So

```
The pilgrim on the path to liberation from his lower self
Casts off all his desires as useless ballast;
Naked he enters the temple of the highest initiation
The tabernacle' s portal is the grave.
```
As a pupil, or someone who is interested in the Gnosis, you
know the need to become a freemason and build the holy
cathedral stone by stone. The holy mountain, Mont Salvat,
is invisible in matter, yet, by passing through the grave of
the lower nature, you may enter there and join the master-
masons as an apprentice. Learn, then, from Lao Tzu, your


```
INTRODUCTION
```
fundamental impediments and the key to Tao

```
The highest knowledge is to acknowledge that we know
nothing.
This not-knowing makes us tranquil and devout.
In letters we may know more than illiterates,
But as to the profound mystery of life and death, we know
not one jot more.
```
Man's real illness lies in `not knowing that he does not know'.
Yet you should not think Lao Tzu is recommending some kind
of negative, mystical dependence, some kind of mystical
rejection of the fruits of understanding. No, Lao Tzu is simply
saying that the mentality is like a dam, preventing the flow of
the spirit, and that is the reason why your way of thinking must
be set aside.
Just ask yourself what, in fact, you are doing with your
thinking faculty. You are intellectualising gnostic thoughts
and your heart is mystified by your emotional thoughts. In
this way you erect a dam, preventing the influx of the spirit.
Yet doesn't universal wisdom teach that heart and head must
form a unity
Besides, as long as we refuse to acknowledge that we know
nothing, the highest reality will remain, at most, a beautiful
dream, and only we ourselves can remedy this lack of new
consciousness.

```
He who recognises this sick spot is already healed thereby.
Recognition is the arcanum of this dark disease.
The essence cannot be touched by intellectual thinking.
Neither can the sublime ideal he attained by human deeds.
```
Here is another concept pertaining to the new reality,


```
INTRODUCTION
```
held by brothers and sisters throughout the ages, which has
always been difficult to understand the rejection of
dialectical actions. These enlightened brothers and sisters
knew of another mode of action than that of the dialectical
human being, a quite different form of idealism, another
humanity. They knew only the living, vibrant activity of life
in the new reality, an activity which, to human beings of this
earth, seems to be a limitless void, with neither purpose nor
form.

```
The many, hermetically, seal themselves off,
And, though having eyes, they blindly go their way.
For them, all roads lead from the cradle to the grave,
Their lot in life is more a curse than a blessing.
```
All who live in the twentieth century are conscious of
experiencing life as a curse. But alas, the more accursed life
becomes, the more people seem to cling to it and try to wring
from it the blessings they desire. Understandably, though, the
results are minimal.
The blessings pass by like ships in the night, because the
essence of the Universal Doctrine is not understood and, con-
sequently, one is unable to act in the right way. That is why the
sage of 2500 years ago says

```
One simple line will tell my teaching; My acts to it are
strictly bound.
Yet, interpreted in many ways by man, The core in one
great tangle is obscured.
```
And it is true, isn't it, that the one, simple, essential truth, the
key to the true life, is so often obscured in a great tangle of
pseudo-wisdom and verbosity. But Lao Tzu says


```
INTRODUCTION
Yet I who through the labyrinth can find my way,
Will not by erring lights be led astray.
I hold the thread that leads me to the core;
Peacefully I watch where others uselessly make war.
```
```
On the world's stage I play no part at all,
To the vain, therefore, do I seem insignificant and small.
And while they strive to gain some part in multiplicity,
Mine is the All; 0 true felicity!
```
You see, that is the most important thing — to gain the All.
This may sound rather strange to western ears, but it means
the same as the Christian idea of `sanctification', a term
expressing the magical power of a spirit made holy in Christ.
The word `holy' is derived from the concept of `becoming
whole'. So to gain the All means to become whole, or holy
once more. The Universal Doctrine shows the pupil that his
microcosm is no longer whole, but badly damaged. Under the
curse of this damaged state he strives to gain something for
himself from the multiplicity of things, and that is why the
curse can never turn into a blessing. That is why he becomes
more and more entangled in matter.
When the pupil realises the uselessness of all this activity
and gives it up, when he has become convinced that higher
expectations can never be realised on the basis of his ego, he
will be forging for himself an impenetrable spiritual armour,
and he will be able to follow the path, the way, Tao, because
the I-delusion within him has been killed. Then the micro-
cosm will be restored to its original condition and the entity
concerned will participate in the All.
So we can see how the message of the present-day
Rosycross is and has been the message of all times since the
Fall; and it is the message of Lao Tzu, proclaimed more than


```
INTRODUCTION
```
2500 years ago. This message will go on resounding until
the seeker sees clearly the road before him and says to the
universal sages

```
I wish to live according to your great and wise example,
To know that I am linked with the divine plan of
creation.
```
One last point the seeker will only see the path, he will
only see Tao when he discovers that `he is suffering in the
ego', as Lao Tzu puts it; when he discovers that nothing
and no one can heal him of this pain, that no one can put
out this fire, until he himself says farewell to his I-being.
Then, `the great lamp of the All-consciousness' will begin
to burn for the pilgrim, and he will be imbued with this
divine radiance which, as a consolamentum, will raise
him up out of the night of his suffering.


_Could Tao he spoken, it would not he the eternal Tao.
Could the name be named, it would not he the eternal name._

_As not-being, it can he described as the foundation of all that
exists. As being, it is the Mother of all things._

_Therefore, if the heart constantly 'is not' — that is, if it is free
of all earthly aspirations and desires — one can behold the
mystery of Tao's spiritual essence. If the heart constantly 'is'
— that is, if it is full of desires and earthly aspirations —
one can only behold limited, finite forms._

_Both, being and not-being, spring from the same source, but
differ in their goals and effects._

_Both are full of mystery, and this mystery is the gate unto life._

```
Tao Te Ching, chapter 1
```

### 1

### Being and not-being

The Tao Te Ching could rightly be called the Chinese Bible.
The author carries the same signature as all the great
teachers of humankind. Many legends surround Lao Tzu,
but they have no historical foundation, so we do not want to
repeat them here. The whole question of whether Lao Tzu
even existed is shrouded in mist. There are those who deny
his existence, and there are those who assert it with equal
vehemence. So it is just the same as with Buddha, Jesus the
Lord and Hermes Trismegistus. But we do not have to dwell
on all this, because we need only remind ourselves of the
words of Silesius `Though Christ a thousand times in
Bethlehem be born and not within yourself, you will yet be
forlorn.'
The important thing is that we possess the Tao Te Ching.
And it bears the signature of the Universal Brotherhood and
its Doctrine, revealed to humankind with incomparable love.
The entity responsible for revealing this ray of love did not
want to vaunt himself in any way. He lost himself in the
impersonal; he came, and he went. His kingdom was not of
this world. Six hundred years before Christ, the Word
descended into China, and afterwards, the bringer of that
Word withdrew `across the borders'; he crossed the borders
of the world of dialectics and returned to the one Fatherland.
We can take it that this holy language has been mutilated
only slightly or not at all. This is because very few people
have been able to understand the Tao Te Ching, owing to the
fact that it was written in Chinese characters. It was written in
a compact, very veiled way, and consists of only eighty-one


```
BEING AND NOT-BEING
```
verses or aphorisms. These aphorisms are divided into two
sections the Tao, and the Te. We would like to describe _Tao_
as `the path of liberation', and _Te_ as `the benefit and the
results of the path of liberation', while the word _Ching_ indi-
cates that the Tao and the Te together comprise the _method_ of
liberation.
We will not be giving a literal translation of the Tao Te
Ching (we are not Chinese scholars), but a paraphrase. Inci-
dentally, it has to be said that hardly any Chinese scholars are
in agreement about the translation of either the title or the
text. We will more or less be following Henri Borel's trans-
lation, for there are reasons why we consider this translation
the most reliable.
The Tao Te Ching has not been known in Europe for very
long — one and a half centuries or so at the most. The first
European translation appeared in French in 1823, and since
then many books have been written about it. And now we,
too, are going to write about the Tao Te Ching. The reason
lies in the fact that a new, mighty Taoist Brotherhood is rising
in the east. It is a Brotherhood, a School, with the same signa-
ture and aims as ours, a Brotherhood that, like us, consecrated
its temple in December 1951 and that, like us, has taken its
place in the Chain of Seven. And in the time which has now
dawned, it will be natural for all participants in that sevenfold
Chain of the Brotherhood to grow towards each other. East
and west, north and south, will meet each other as newly-
awakened children of God, who will need to recognise each
other not only in signature but also in inner language.
That is why you need to know and taste Tao, and all other
wisdom-teachings, so that you can live, speak and act from their
synthesis, freeing yourself of your own particular national
characteristics in order to become a true world-citizen of the
universal people of God. So what we have to say here


```
BEING AND NOT-BEING
```
should serve, among other things, as a preparation for contact
between all those who will be gathered together from the cor-
ners of the earth. This preparation is a task that needs to be
fulfilled, and we would like to offer you our heartfelt invitation
to join us in it. Join us in bringing this task to a good end!

There have never been many people who understood Tao.
The greatest nonsense has been written about it. So are we to
be counted among those who say they _do_ understand and,
full of self-confidence, tell you `we can easily explain its
profound meaning' No, we want to offer our efforts in the
deepest humility, mindful of the last verse of the Chinese
Bible _Those who know Tao are not learned; those who are
learned do not know Tao_ (verse 81). If only the soul is re-
ceptive to the new life, we will certainly understand! The
first chapter of the Tao Te Ching reads as follows

_The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao. The
name that can be named is not the eternal name._

_As not-being, it can be described as the foundation of all that
exists. As being, it is the Mother of all things._

_Therefore, if the heart constantly 'is not' —_ that is, if it is free
of all earthly aspirations and desires — _one can behold the
mystery of Tao's spiritual essence. If the heart constantly `is'_
— that is, if it is full of desires and earthly aspirations — _one
can only behold limited, finite forms._

_Both, being and not-being, spring from the same source, but
differ in their goals and effects._

_Both are full of mystery, and this mystery is the gate unto life._

The first chapter of the Tao Te Ching delineates the main
characteristics of the Universal Doctrine, which have always


```
BEING AND NOT-BEING
```
been the same. The original foundation of all things Lao Tzu
calls _Tao._ This word could also be translated simply as our
word `God' or, as John does, by the term `The Word' `In the
beginning was the Word, to which everything must return'. So it
is a stream, a current — the way.
This Word, this Tao, cannot be spoken. It cannot be per-
fectly described by any mortal. At most it can be hinted at, or
approximated. `No man has ever seen God', says John, echo-
ing the words of Lao Tzu. If Tao could be spoken in full,
intellectually or philosophically expounded, it would not be
the eternal Tao. Something can only be expressed fully in
words if it lies within the limits of this world of duality. This
statement alone is sufficient to show quite clearly the limita-
tions of the earthly human being. No one has ever seen God,
not one single mortal is capable of seeing Him; only the Son,
who is in the heart of the Father, can make Him known, and
he does so by manifesting Him from within his own being.
Who is this Son This Son is a historical figure and at the
same time an actual, living reality. The primordial atom is the
Son in embryonic form, and He has been revealed in many,
not only in the past, but also in the living present. The Son is
always the one who awakens the primordial atom, the rose,
the divine seed. Such a one will meet God; he will approach
the Gnosis, just as the Gnosis, Tao, will approach him.
If you are a pupil of the Spiritual School of the Golden
Rosycross, you will know the key to this mystery of sanctifi-
cation. 2500 years ago, Lao Tzu had already placed it in the
hands of humankind.

_If the heart constantly 'is not' —_ that is, if it is free of all earthly
aspirations and desires — _one can behold the mystery of Tao's
spiritual essence._

Hasn't the Spiritual School often told you that if you open


```
BEING AND NOT-BEING
```
your heart sanctuary to the radiation-power of the new life,
you will be touched by the spiritual essence The heart must
exist in the state of _not-being._ If it is in the state of _being,_ it
will be filled with a thousand and one worries, desires and
concerns of ordinary nature. Just as the mind is constantly
being agitated by thoughts, so the heart is filled to bursting
point with all kinds of feelings and desires.
Thinking, willing, feeling and desiring together form one
of the sides of the earthly light-triangle. And who among us
can say he has entered total silence in that respect Who has
entered the stillness of not-being, of not-doing All the tur-
moil of existence in the world of antitheses, and our incessant
preoccupation with mental activity on that level, impede the
functioning of the primordial atom. Only by entering the
stillness of not-doing, only by withdrawing from dialectics,
can one clear a path through the desert of this life. The still-
ness is the precursor of Tao's spiritual essence, just as John is
the precursor of Jesus. Through stillness, the primordial atom
is awakened from its sleep of aeons.
What is the aim of that awakening Well, it concerns the
new, the original life. Lao Tzu calls it the path leads to not-
being, _and_ to being. Not-being is the foundation of all that
exists; being is the Mother of all things. Not-being does not
mean not existing, or non-being in the sense of a total absence
of being; it is the absolute, original state, the original, immor-
tal glory. It is a `new-being', in the original state of the
Immovable Kingdom. Being as we know it is the being of
death, suffering and tears. That kind of being cannot arise
from Tao. That is why there is also an original being, arising
from the same source of the absolute, as true not-being.
Lao Tzu gave this message to humankind several thousand
years ago, and it sounds very familiar, because it is still being
proclaimed today. From Tao, from the Gnosis, there


```
BEING AND NOT-BEING
```
arises a source, a fount, from which not-being and being
arise. An eternal, irresistible power, in the midst of which
the Immovable Kingdom stands like a rock. And the heart
that has entered the stillness experiences the pulsation of
Tao's spiritual essence. Such a heart forms the mystery of
the `gate unto life'.



_All under heaven know so well that beauty is 'beautiful', that
it splits into ugliness. All know so well that goodness is
'good', that it splits into evil._

_Being and not-being give birth to one another._

_Difficult and easy beget one another. Long and short generate
one another. High and low bring forth one another. The tone
and the voice harmonise one another. Before and after follow
one another._

_That is why the sage engages in not-doing; he carries out the
teachings without words._

_When the work is completed, he is not attached to it. Precisely
because he is not attached to it, it will not leave him._

## 2 Wu Wei

We would like to focus on the following words, taken from the
quotation opposite _That is why the sage engages in not-doing;
he carries out the teachings without words._
The second chapter of this archaic Chinese gospel builds
on the foundations laid in the first, and reveals even more
clearly the essence underlying the world of antitheses, or
what we call `the dialectical nature-order'. It shows that all
entities belonging to this nature-order help to maintain it by
obeying and feeding the law of antitheses in everything they
do. Lao Tzu shows that everything in this nature-order is a
delusion, unreal in relation to the essential, the absolute, the
divine. No doubt it could be said that dialectics possesses a
certain kind of reality, but it is a reality which can in no way
be compared with the absolute, the original.
Lao Tzu explains that since, in this world, everything is
subject to the law of antitheses and hence to change, it is
senseless to cling to the phenomena arising from it, because
they are transitory. But in this world of fundamental un-
reality, people refuse to accept its laws, and they try to make
it into something real, despite their invariable experience that
whatever they have tried to do always turns into its opposite.
Everyone has a certain concept of what constitutes beauty,
for instance. Yet our impressions of beauty, the things we
consider to be beautiful, differ widely. They are not only
influenced by the period in which one lives, by nationality
and race, customs and manners, education and culture, but
above all, they are extremely personal. In addition, our views
on what is beautiful are often influenced by authorities, such


```
WU WEI
```
as teachers, parents and artists. And that is why fierce quarrels
can arise, when one person expresses dislike for what another
person finds beautiful. But whether a thing is truly beautiful, no
one knows.
That is how it can happen that you become attached to cer-
tain things you find beautiful, even to the extent, as it were,
that you luxuriate in them every day, just because you enjoy
them so much. And you would be most disappointed, and even
shocked, if someone were to say to you, possibly in all
innocence, `I don't like that at all. How could you' Possibly,
you would feel injured to the depths of your soul. Why
Because you feel intuitively that beauty in this dialectical
nature is only a semblance. You do not know the reality of
beauty, with which your impressions of it could be compared.
You might be inclined to see beauty in nature, in a forest,
for instance. But if you look more closely, it is no exagger-
ation to say that you will find much to be desired. You see
some scenery, and exclaim enthusiastically, `Oh, how beauti-
ful!' but when you come closer and observe it objectively, you
are bound to see ugliness in it as well, sometimes even to
such an extent that you turn away in disappointment. Travel-
ling through the mountains, one sometimes comes across a
beautiful valley whose colours and form fill one with wonder.
Edgar Allen Poe once wrote about such a valley in one of his
stories, in his own inimitable and penetrating way. The visi-
tors to the valley, when they went down into the village,
found that literally everything in it was in conflict with beauty
and harmony. They then had to submit to the harsh reality of
ugliness.
As regards true Beauty, humankind is utterly destitute, and
that is why he is so attached to illusion. Because of his miser-
able condition, he tries to lie ugliness out of existence. But that
doesn't work, because if one build's one's life on delu-


```
WU WEI
```
sion, on what is unreal, one provokes counter-reactions. If you
discover that something is wrong with a particular situation
— a situation you were formerly convinced was wonderful —
you will probably be unwilling to accept your discovery at
first. But the further you continue, the more the reality of the
ugliness impresses itself upon you. And you see that you have
been engrossed in a degeneration caused by delusion. Both
the delusion of beauty and the delusion of goodness bring
ugliness to the surface.
Now you may be thinking, `If goodness and beauty in our
nature are delusions, then surely you must say the same about
badness and ugliness. Badness and ugliness must be delu-
sions, too. If we carry that proposition to its logical conclu-
sion, then we could call ugliness beautiful and evil good.' But
that would be a mistake, a fallacy! There are people who hold
such convictions, and there are various groups, such as the
Christian Scientists, who try to deny the reality of ugliness,
imperfection, illness and pain. They say `All this misery and
ugliness is not real. If only you hold on firmly to that thought,
it will turn into its opposite and you will recover.' But they
also develop illnesses to which they succumb, sooner or later.
If we try to lie ugliness out of existence, we provoke
unpleasant reactions, for beauty and ugliness, good and bad,
are not equivalent. If we say that beauty is a delusion, one
may not simply draw the conclusion that ugliness is a
delusion as well. No, ugliness is proof of the delusion of
beauty. If you are attached to a delusion, ugliness will
appear, to reveal to you the fact that you were deluded.
Ugliness is the proof that beauty is not beautiful, just as evil
is the proof that goodness is not good. So beauty and
goodness as the ego sees them are lies; the appearance of
ugliness and evil proves this to us. So it could be said that
ugliness and evil are essential in this nature-order, an
inevitable part of this nature-order. In es-


```
WU WEI
```
sence, this world is characterised by the most wretched misery.
Perhaps you don't agree with us about this; perhaps you haven't
become conscious of it yet. But as you continue on your path
through life, you are bound to see the truth of what we are
saying in the end.
The beauty and goodness of this nature are lies. If this were
not the case, beauty would bring forth beauty, and goodness
would bring forth goodness. If you possessed anything
genuinely good, do you think it could turn into bad Or ugli-
ness Quite impossible! What you believe to be beauty is a
delusion, and that is why it always brings ugliness to the sur-
face.
There is one more question you might think of asking `If
we were to combat ugliness and evil in this world, would we
not be able to turn them into good Could we not raise this
society, this world, this order of existence, into the light'
Humankind has made countless attempts to do this. But look
at the results and you will see how, throughout the ages,
they have always been negative. No, if you really want a
solution, you will first need to relinquish all aspects of your
delusion. When we put it like that, you may think what we are
telling you is quite ordinary, and say without hesitation `Yes,
of course. _That_ is the solution. People are always trying to
camouflage ugliness and evil, the essential aspects of our
nature-order, in a cloak of delusion. So let us do away with all
that pretence!' But when you have done that, when you have
neutralised all the delusion in your everyday life, what will
you have left Nothing except ugliness! Loneliness, deso-
lation, drabness — absolute, monotonous ugliness! Look
around you, and you will see how people all over the world
are jettisoning delusion. And what comes in its place One
great horror of dehumanisation and brutality!
Right there, at that point, is where Lao Tzu has driven us


```
WU WEI
```
into a corner. Many people are striving to overcome delusion
in their lives. But inevitably, what they are left with is ugli-
ness, unspeakable ugliness. So if you find yourself in that
corner into which we are driven by the ancient Chinese Bible,
if you have seen through all that delusion and outward show,
and have experienced the bleak misery and hopelessness of
this nature-order and recognised it for what it is, then only
one solution will be open to you that you detach yourself
from this dualistic nature; that you turn away from this world
of delusion and follow the path of transfiguristic revolution,
the path of return to the House of the Father. Then, like the
prodigal son, you will know that here you are among the
swine, eating pigswill. And only one solution will remain —
to rise up from this life of delusion and say, in life-renewing
action `I shall return to the Father, to the Father's House, to
the original Fatherland.'
This revolution must naturally have a beginning, a method
that one uses at the start of the process. And this is what we
would like to describe, aided by Lao Tzu's text. Lao Tzu
called this method `not-doing', or wu wei. We have talked
about this before in the School, but at that time the majority of
pupils did not understand what we meant. It is possible to
describe this method intellectually. But what use would that
be How could that liberate you So we would like to try once
more to give you some understanding of the doctrine of not-
doing, and to anchor it in your soul. We would like to try to
deepen your understanding of wu wei, because the wise soul
must engage in not-doing.

Let us put it this way you enter the School of the Golden
Rosycross as a beginning pupil, and inevitably, you are filled
with enthusiasm and joy, and the best of intentions. And
because of your enthusiasm, you fling yourself with great


```
WU WEI
```
energy into the teachings and into the life that the School
seeks to reveal to you. But the behaviour resulting from this
sparkling enthusiasm and dynamism, which we observe in
almost every new pupil, is not at all in keeping with the libe-
rating method of not-doing. Because by this typically dialec-
tical behaviour you invoke the law of antitheses, you set it in
motion. You find the School beautiful, you find it good, and
you surround it in a golden glow. But in the world of dialec-
tics, the beautiful and the good invariably bring forth ugliness
and evil, thereby proving the delusion and unreality of what
was perceived as beauty.
If you are an older pupil, who has perhaps been in the
School for many years, may we ask you whether there are not
times when all the things you thought to be beautiful seem
dreary and ugly, so that you say, disconsolately, `I have been
doing my best for so many years, and what do I have to show
for it' And you are flung back to your starting point, back to
the loneliness, the ugliness, the drabness. As a reaction to this,
the thought often arises that something is wrong with the
School. Yet that is not the right reaction! Because it is the law
of antitheses that makes beauty turn into ugliness.
So your enthusiastic behaviour, the dynamic way in which
you threw yourself into the work of the School, turns out not
to have been a reality in the divine sense. In a way, your
enthusiasm was a purely dialectical reaction, a reaction of
your nature-born ego. That is why the time always comes
when your joy reverts to disappointment, sorrow, loneliness
and weariness, and you fall into habits, into a condition of
crystallisation. Then a new impulse is often necessary to
make you enthusiastic and joyful. Very often with the same
result.
In this way, a kind of psychological cramp arises, full of ups
and downs. And on you go. When you think about all this,


```
WU WEI
```
you will perhaps be bewildered, and ask yourself, or ask us
`Am I not supposed to be joyful, then Am I not meant to be
enthusiastic about having found the School May I not be
pleased and grateful that I see the path of liberation before me
If this mercy, and the joy I feel because of it, give rise to such a
downfall, what in heaven's name must I do'
Well, no one, and least of all the Brotherhood of Salvation,
wants to take that joy away from you. But we do need to
advise you to change your psychological reactions to that joy
in a fundamental way. Just think for a while about what
people do when they are filled with feelings of joy and grati-
tude. In their enthusiasm, they feel like embracing everyone,
and everything seems good and beautiful to them. They want
to rush headlong into the liberating life. But that is a misgui-
ded and unintelligent reaction.

Instead, when what is holy enters your life, there should be
what the Bible calls a tranquil joy, an _experiencing_ of the
doctrine, without words. Not-doing does not mean simply
withdrawing from dialectics, as you may have thought. It does
not mean just distancing yourself from ordinary life, so that
you are not drawn into it any more. If your pupilship is
genuine, you will do these things quite spontaneously. If you
have recognised the ugliness, the emptiness, the delusion of
dialectics, if you have tasted the nature of death in its deepest
essence, then you will surely take leave of it, as a matter of
course. No, the not-doing of Lao Tzu means that you do not
grasp at the values, the forces, the essence of the Immovable
Kingdom with your ego. `Do not do that,' is what is being said
to you. Do not touch! If you lay hold of the things of the
Immovable Kingdom with your hands, if you pounce on them
with your I, you will be thrown back.
`Flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.' The
urge to possess is part of human nature, but the things of the


```
WU WEI
```
Immovable Kingdom cannot be grasped with one's fingers.
Do not do that! It is simply not possible to possess the divine
on the basis of one's natural state. So any attempt to do so is
bound to end in trouble and disappointment. It may also be
accompanied by illness, over-excitement, nervous disorders,
disturbances of the endocrine system, and overshadowing.
The new life comes neither into the I, nor for the I, nor
through the I of this nature. With the I, only mysticism and
occultism are possible. There are parts of the reflection
sphere, the realm of the dead, in which various occult
brotherhoods maintain themselves in a domain of delusion
which they have created. One can certainly make a link with
domains like these, but that will only mean one has been
taken in by a delusion from which one will someday have to
fall, having sustained serious damage.
In view of all this, even a child could understand that if a
person yearns for genuine liberation from the nature of death,
his ego must engage in not-doing, and must stop trying to grasp
the new life, the Universal Brotherhood, and everything related
to it in any way. That is what you must not do. So do not
concentrate, do not meditate, and above all, do not fantasise.
Keep to absolute `not-doing'!
The method of not-doing is a still, tranquil joy. One goes
forward in that joy, in total self-surrender to the Kingdom
within you, the primordial atom. That is what is meant by
`engaging in not-doing'. That is what is meant by 'experiencing
the doctrine without words'. `Not I, but He, the Other One, who
is more than I, must increase. And I must perish; I must sink
into the Other One, into that Other Being, contained within the
primordial atom.'
When a worker in the Spiritual School is given a task, he is
undertaking the most difficult work of all. He will have to walk
on a path as narrow as a razor's edge. For the worker will


```
WU WEI
```
not be able to carry out his task as an I-being. If he tries to do
so, he will plummet like a meteor. No one else makes him do
that. He is not expelled from the School, as is sometimes be-
lieved. No, he does it to himself. For the worker who wishes to
serve, only one way is open, the way of not-doing. He serves in
a state of tranquil joy, safeguarding the task in the heart, and in
an attitude of profound modesty and absolute devotion to the
mystery of the primordial atom. For it is from the temple of the
primordial atom that the work must be fulfilled, after the
manner of all great heralds of the Universal Doctrine, past and
present, who did what they had to do and then vanished, as if
into the mist. That is why the pupil who is fulfilling the work in
his own being, in the service of others, will not be attached to
that work; he will not cling to it with his ego.
Under no circumstances will the ego push itself forward.
Attempts to push oneself to the forefront in the work, or to carry
it out from the standpoint of one's ego, are evidence of the most
pronounced egocentricity imaginable. Such attempts mean that
one is misusing Jesus Christ to bring oneself to the top of the
wall or over it. Clearly, grace will depart from such persons; it
has no option but to flee.

_That is why the sage engages in not-doing; he carries out the
teachings without words._

That is the mystery of salvation _precisely because he is not
attached to it, it will not leave him._ If you follow the path in
self-surrender, as a silent observer, you will discover that
even though, inwardly, you always remain detached, the new
life will shine over you. The new life is not of you, but of the
Other One, in whom your own dialectical self melts entirely
away. And that is the meaning of not-doing. That is the Way,
the Path. That is Tao.


_Do not attach status to worthiness, then the people will not
quarrel._

_Do not attach high value to goods difficult to obtain, then the
people will not steal._

_Do not cherish earthly desires, then the people's hearts will not
be confused._

_Therefore, the sage rules by emptying hearts of desire, filling
bellies, weakening bad tendencies, and strengthening the
bones._

_Always, he sees to it that the people remain innocent and
without desires._

_If that does not entirely succeed, he ensures that those who are
not innocent do not dare to agitate._

_He practises wu wei, and then there is nothing in which he does
not rule well._

Tao Te Ching chapter 3
```

# 3

## 3 Do not attach status to worthiness

Read superficially, this paragraph of the Tao Te Ching seems
to be all about a social order whose dictates are way out of date
for people of the twentieth century. A modern professor of
social politics would just give a shrug, shake his head and say,
`As far as I'm concerned, you can put the Tao Te Ching back in
your bookcase. It's antiquated, and far too conservative for
modern times.'
We wouldn't follow this advice, however. Because when
we look more closely at what is said, we understand that this
third chapter is addressed to rulers; rulers of a kind no longer
known in our modern times, rulers who belonged to and lived
entirely on the basis of the new life. The Tao Te Ching pro-
poses a system of government that would be impossible to
apply in our era, a system no one would want to use and
against which people would rebel.
We are concerned, here, with a system of government, a
socio-political strategy belonging to a period, long ago,
when China could still genuinely be called the `Heavenly
Realm'. It is a system we believe was last used (and that in
an experimental way) by the mysterious Akhenaten in anci-
ent Egypt. Akhenaten's reign, however, did not last very
long. It was destroyed by the intrigues of an evil
priesthood. Anyway, though not obsolete, this socio-
political paragraph from the Tao is no longer applicable in
our times, unless, perhaps, as guidelines for parents to use
in the bringing up of their children.
Even so, we would like to make an analysis of the third
chapter, because it gives such a clear image of a prehistoric


```
DO NOT ATTACH STATUS TO WORTHINESS
```
period in the development of the human life-wave, a period
much further back than 2500 years ago when the Tao is
reputed to have been written down. This is proof that the
Tao is many thousands of years old.
Let us return, then, to the beginning of the most recent
epoch, the Aryan epoch, at which time the remnant of fallen
humanity was again brought into manifestation in the world
of antitheses. This remnant was the group of those whom it
had not been possible to liberate during the previous epoch,
and who therefore could not be brought back to the original
life.
Though we speak of a remnant, we are nevertheless con-
cerned with people who were, once, children of God. Foun-
dations therefore had to be laid to provide a possibility of
returning to that former state, and that is why this `remnant'
was surrounded by the Universal Brotherhood with the
greatest concern and care at the dawn of its new existence in
the nature of death. Many messengers of the Universal
Brotherhood, many of those who had already been saved,
therefore mingled with humankind at this time of new
beginning, appearing as kings, rulers and priests. All these
authorities together formed a sublime Brotherhood, in the
service of `the last remnant'. All the participants in this
Brotherhood were linked internationally and they governed
humankind in its new endeavour in keeping with an interna-
tionally coordinated system, the socio-political system
described in the third chapter of the Tao.
Suppose you were such a ruler. Then you would be aware
of the grave dangers inherent in delusion and the law of
antitheses. When a person seeks liberation on the horizontal
level and these efforts reveal to him the reality of his impri-
sonment, yet he nevertheless persists in his activities, he will
accelerate the interchange of antitheses. Then he will work


```
DO NOT ATTACH STATUS TO WORTHINESS
```
his way even deeper into the morass of death and crystallisation.
He will entangle himself even more in the essence of self-
preservation and conflict. So, imagine a group of people had
been entrusted to your guidance, people you knew had just
awoken from a cosmic night after a terrible fall, people you
knew possessed a rosebud, while you understood from
experience the delusions and pitfalls of dialectics. What would
you have done
Surely, you would have done your best to ensure that
their culture did not develop along dialectical lines. With
your utmost care, you would have guided the people in the
direction you saw as the only one possible. You would have
protected them from the archons of the aeons, from the
influences of the nature of death. In everything you did for
the people, you would have kept your eyes fixed on that
one, primary goal the return home.
But the people would not have been aware of that goal,
any more than a child who had just entered the world once
again. The people would only have been aware of `I am', `I
am alive'. And they would have had to live out of their soul-
state; as such, they would have been sufficient unto
themselves.
Now suppose you were such a person and, in the Spiritual
School, separated from matter, you had been entrusted to our
care. What would we do As far as possible, we would try to
keep you away from degeneration as it exists in the cosmos.
We would not try to keep you ignorant, but we would try to
keep you untouched by any temptation to fall, by encircling
you with pure vibrations. And in this period we would try to
bring about the great work of self-emptying in the service of
the imperishable rose.
Now that the end of another Day of Manifestation has
almost been reached once again, and an attempt is being


```
DO NOT ATTACH STATUS TO WORTHINESS
```
made to enable as many entities as possible to participate in
the third magnetic field, our thoughts are naturally drawn to
the beginning of this Day of Manifestation, when the
Brotherhood, striking while the iron was hot, tried in the
same way to help as many people as possible — and with
great success! In the mystery temples of the Brotherhood of
Shamballa, tens of thousands were helped on the path of lib-
eration.
The third chapter of the Tao contains instructions for the
kings, priests and rulers who worked at the dawn of the Aryan
manifestation

_Do not attach status to worthiness, then the people will not
quarrel._

Fame and honour are common incentives to action. It is usu-
ally very easy to trade on human ambition. The depths to
which our so-called civilisation has descended can be
measured by all the titles and knighthoods, all the rewards
for successes achieved by ambition. And look at the quarrels
caused by ambitious people, all jostling with each other to
gain some prize or other. Economic methods are based on
such competition, and wars are caused by it. That is why
humankind's original leaders would never have exalted
themselves on account of any individual merit they may
have possessed. They took care to avoid anything that could
have given rise to jealousy. Merit, genuine merit, can only
be spiritual, and the way to that merit is open to all.
Neither was any value attached to things like precious
metals, for instance, that were difficult to come by. It is known
that ancient peoples had no lust for gold — the metal of the sun
— purely and simply because nothing could be had in
exchange for it. Rarity was never made into the basis of an
economic system and in this way, theft was prevented; in


```
DO NOT ATTACH STATUS TO WORTHINESS
```
those times, theft was unknown. No member of the Brother-
hood cherished any earthly desires, and thus no child-human
being could be confused by a bad example. By such
measures, the sages kept hearts empty of desire. They took
care that the products necessary for bodily sustenance were
shared out fairly, and careful eye was kept on each person's
inclinations. Any influences originating from discarnate
forces were neutralised, and people's health was cared for
assiduously.
Poverty and disease were unknown, and in the temples
care was taken to ensure that the powerfield emitted a good
atmosphere. In this way the people were preserved from
any possible degeneration, and at the same time all harmful
desires were neutralised. Any enemy was powerless. Thus,
for thousands of years, a state of life was preserved which,
seen from a dialectical point of view, was ideal. The few
entities in those times who were in the grip of the forces of
degeneration were unable to cause any disturbance in that
powerfield. Thus the Brotherhood of Shamballa lived in the
daily practice of not-doing, and the results were wholly
beneficial.
But those times have passed. After the great harvest that
took place at the dawn of the Aryan epoch, matters took their
ordinary course, until now. The Brotherhood always adapted
itself to every situation, so as to continue with its work of
salvation until this very hour.
We may be very thankful that the method of not-doing,
as practised by us, has lost none of its power, because it
means we can apply this social paragraph to our present
situation in the Spiritual School of the Golden Rosycross.
If, as workers, we keep to these guidelines, then together
we will be able to lead the pupils to the goal with the
minimum of trouble.


DO NOT ATTACH STATUS TO WORTHINESS
It must be emphasised that this ancient gospel, this
compendium of the Universal Doctrine, is still valid as a
practical guide to the holy work. Just as it has been
throughout all the ages, so it is now! That is why we want
to draw your attention to the final verses of the third
chapter

_Always he sees to it that the people remain innocent and without
desires._

_If this does not entirely succeed, he ensures that those who are
not innocent do not dare to agitate._

_He practises wu wei, and then there is nothing in which he does
not rule well._

In practice, this means that bona fide pupils of the Spiritual
School are kept together and nourished by a properly func-
tioning powerfield. As regards the state of their pupilship
and its results, they are protected by the powerfield. In
view of all this, the guardians of the powerfield do not per-
mit alien influences hostile to the work to enter the power-
field. Any who dare to attack the powerfield from within
are ejected without compunction. And if those who remain
within the powerfield harbour any hostile intentions, care is
taken that they neither dare nor are able to give vent to
them.
One might ask whether something could be judged as hos-
tile when in fact it was not, or when it may even have been in
the interests of the powerfield. One might also wonder
whether the position adopted by the leaders and guardians of
the powerfield is too authoritarian.
But if the guardians of the powerfield stand in wu wei, in
not-doing, in impersonal service to the Brotherhood, there


```
DO NOT ATTACH STATUS TO WORTHINESS
```
can be nothing in which they do not rule well, and any
ensuing situation will not be dialectical, but positive, in the
new, esoteric sense.
What will prove that this is the case The facts, the
results. Look at the facts, and you will know.


_Tao is empty, and in its radiations and activities, it is
inexhaustible._

_Oh, the depth of it. It is the Original Father of all things. It
softens its sharpness, simplifies its complexity, tempers its
blinding radiance and makes itself akin to the dust._

_Oh, the tranquillity of it. It exists eternally._

_I know not whose Child it is. Ere the highest God was, it was._

Tao Te Ching chapter 4

# 4

## 4 Tao is empty

The Tao Te Ching is not intended for ordinary people, but
for pupils on the path. It is not a mundane explanation of a
philosophical system, but a collection of directives and laws
which apply to those on the path. It contains not merely a
few directions, but all the directions one needs to avoid
every single pitfall there could possibly be. It is truly a
royal law.
Neither are the contents intended only for very advanced
entities, in which case they would be difficult for beginners to
understand. On the contrary, this gospel has everything to say
to the beginner. Is it not precisely that `difficult beginning'
which always plays tricks on us Just one mistake can leave us
so exhausted, so sick and so weak that we may be put out of
action for some considerable time. That is why beginners, in
particular, need to read, re-read and study the Tao Te Ching
word by word. If you can understand the words of the Tao Te
Ching, they will aid you in every danger.
Just take the first sentence of chapter four _Tao is empty._ To
our ordinary understanding, to our ordinary sensory faculties,
the senses of touch, smell, taste and hearing, Tao is empty. It
cannot be perceived. Neither can Tao be grasped with our
thoughts, and anything we may imagine in this regard, however
infinitesimal, is an error. And neither can Tao be attracted or
controlled with the magnetic faculty of the will. To the
dialectical state of being in all its aspects, Tao is absolutely
empty. That is why the method of not-doing is not merely a
recommended course of action, but the essential foundation for
all genuinely liberating work. With the ego and its intel-


```
TAO IS EMPTY
```
lectual and mystical faculties, nothing essential, nothing lib-
erating, can be grasped. For the ego, Tao is empty.
The reason why Tao is empty to the dialectical faculties, to
the ego and to the present state of the microcosm, lies in the
fact that the vibration-field of Tao — the serene astral field of
the Brotherhood — rises far above our ordinary field of life in
subtlety, velocity and ability. Tao imparts itself to a magnetic
astral field other than ours.
`That's not right,' you will be saying, `because it says that
_Tao makes itself akin to the dust.'_ Now you should under-
stand this to mean that Tao has endless love for fallen beings.
But are you such a fallen being No, you are not! You belong
to this nature — you are of this nature — your beginning and
your end can be traced and established precisely. You are
only a manifestation of this nature, a being with a mortal soul.
So why don't you feel at home here Why do you feel so
lonely and forsaken Well, that is the reaction of the `Other
One' in you. That feeling is caused by the activity of the
primordial atom, the rose, and what lies within it. Only to that
Other One does Tao impart and reveal itself, but to you, as an
ego, Tao is empty.
`So in that case, what have I to do with it all Why should I
concern myself with all these things'
Well, that Other One, for whom Tao is intended, lies
imprisoned within you, and only you can set him free, by
allowing him to awaken in you, through self-surrender and
your willingness to be completely dissolved for his sake. You
must perform this work in wu wei, in the practice of not-
doing, in self-surrender to the primordial atom in your micro-
cosm. This should not be seen as some kind of melodramatic
effort to destroy yourself. No, what happens through self-
surrender is that the dialectical self fades into the Other One;
something of the old I is replaced by the new I, and its rad-


```
TAO IS EMPTY
```
iance can be perceived. That is why Paul could jubilate `Not I,
but Christ in me.' But as long as the ego of ordinary nature has
not surrendered itself to the Other One, as long as one does not
know wu wei, Tao remains empty.
No two people are completely alike. Although all of us
have followed the same descending path, this path has been
coloured by personal experiences and occurrences and,
throughout the microcosm's many incarnations, all this has
had a tremendous influence on the state of the primordial
atom, on the condition of the rosebud and its imprisonment.
Accordingly, each of us has a different curriculum to follow
with respect to the great work. So in that sense, when you
enter the valley of death of self-surrender, you are on your
own. What you have to do, no one can do for you, not even
your friends.
However, that need not worry you, because listen to what
the Tao Te Ching says next when the pilgrim enters his per-
sonal valley of death, he discovers that Tao's radiations and
activities are inexhaustible. This is a wonderful truth, and to
experience it is even more wonderful.
Your personality exists in the midst of a magnetic field.
We call it the magnetic field of the microcosm. By means of
this magnetic field, the mortal soul is connected with the
microcosm and with the macrocosm of the nature of death.
All the electromagnetic radiations of the nature of death have
etched a web of magnetic points into this field, and this
magnetic web controls one's entire state of life. However, in
principle, it is also scientifically possible for electromagnetic
radiations of a higher order, of a higher vibration, to manifest
themselves in this magnetic field. The Gnosis, too, can make
its influence felt and leave its mark. But that can only happen
as a result of self-surrender, via the process of the rose. Then
the candidate will experience the felicity of a


```
TAO IS EMPTY
```
new astral-magnetic bond.
Now the word `candidate', (from the Latin _candidus,_ pure
white) means `clothed in white'. You are a pupil of the Spiritual
School, but are you also a `candidate' Are you clothed in the
white purity of your motives, in a self-surrender that is not
affected but totally genuine
Only in that purity will Tao come to you; only in that purity
will the power of the magnetic Living Body of the Spiritual
School become your share.

# The All-Manifestation does not

# love as humans do

Have you ever had the experience of knowing a certain truth in
theory rather than practice for years and years, and then one
day, suddenly discovering the reality behind that truth, and
seeing it spread its light That is how it is when, practising wu
wei, you experience Tao's inexhaustibility. You suddenly
discover that there is a gnostic activity which adapts itself to
your own, individual state of being, and the tremendous
realisation comes to you that this experience is not unique to
you alone, that you are not the only one on whom grace is
bestowed, but that, in the inexhaustibility of Tao's love-
radiations, a bridge of liberation is provided for every indivi-
dual via a magnetic link with the gnostic-astral forces. Hence
Lao Tzu's jubliant words _O, the depth of it. It is the Original
Father of all things._
And then think of all the countless experiences of the pro-
cess of sanctification itself. Here you stand with your fallen
microcosm. Who are you, in comparison with the immeasur-
able glory of Tao And yet, that immeasurability concerns
itself with you. It has discovered you, and touches you

_It softens its sharpness, simplifies its complexity, tempers its
blinding radiance and makes itself akin to the dust._

It makes itself akin to you, and to all; it adapts itself to your
own individual situation, provided you stand in self-surrender.
What a wonderful grace, and also, what an insight, what a pure,
scientific foundation! How else could you be helped
No pupil is ever forced. The Gnosis adapts itself to every


```
THE ALL-MANIFESTATION DOES NOT LOVE AS HUMANS DO
```
situation. It adjusts itself to your pace and remains beside
you at every step, provided you are a `candidate'. Tao
always makes itself completely akin to your natural state; it
softens its sharpness, simplifies its complexity, and tempers
its blinding radiance. No harm can come to you.
Suppose you were to discontinue the liberating work.
Then Tao would immediately become empty to you again,
but ... it would wait for you, in immeasurable love, for
aeons if necessary. Hence the words `O, how tranquil is
Tao, how unfathomable are the depths of its calm; its peace
is inviolable.'
There is a certain sense of urgency in the Spiritual School
and we often talk about the idea that `The time has come',
and this is understandable because this Day of
Manifestation is coming to an end. The Brotherhood would
like to rescue you before the night falls. Nevertheless, even
in the midst of all this, the tranquillity of Tao remains
undisturbed, for Tao is eternal. It has been waiting for you
for an eternity, and it will go on waiting for you for as long
as it takes. There will never be any time in which Tao does
not exist; Tao is parentless. Before the highest God was, it
was. There are many sublime beings, many illustrious
brothers and sisters who are unimaginably far above us in
the majesty of their development. But beyond them all, is
Tao; above even the greatest of them, Tao is enthroned.
That same Tao seeks to become akin to your `dust'; it
tempers its blinding radiance, simplifies its complexity and
softens its sharpness — if only you are willing to be a
`candidate'. So now let us look at the fifth chapter of the Tao
Te Ching

_The All-Manifestation does not love as humans do; it sees all
things as straw clogs._


```
THE ALL-MANIFESTATION DOES NOT LOVE AS HUMANS DO
```
_The sage does not love as humans do; he sees the people as
straw dogs._

_The All is like a bellows. It is empty and never exhausted. The
more it moves, the more is brought into manifestation._

_Many words lead only to depletion. It is better to retain self-
control._

The words _the All-Manifestation does not love as humans do_
may come as rather a shock to you. If they are true, they are
likely to overturn your whole way of viewing life and the
world. That is indeed the aim of that ancient revelation we
know as the Tao Te Ching. When you understand what Lao
Tzu really meant to convey, many of your preconceptions will
be shot to pieces, for it tears apart the whole paradigm with
which humankind has surrounded itself and which has been
handed down from generation to generation since time
immemorial.
You know what it is to love; in one form or radiation or
another, you will have experienced the essence of love.
Leaving aside all the lower aspects and manifestations of
love, there still remains the love you have for your partner
in life, for your children, for your family, or possibly for a
group, nation or race. You have your friends for whom you
bear feelings of love. You also have feelings for the whole
of humankind, which make you want to work for those in
need, or to improve the standards of human life in some
way, or to work for this School, or some other cause.
Without all these aspirations and expressions of the lov-
ing human heart and their results, humankind could not live.
The only thing that gives ordinary life even a spark of value
is the expression of love, in whatever way it may be mani-
fested. If such expressions of love were not possible, life


```
THE ALL-MANIFESTATION DOES NOT LOVE AS HUMANS DO
```
could not go on; it would be unbearable and unacceptable.
The more evolved a person's character, the more beauty it
spreads around it in the form of love and loving behaviour.
There is no mortal on the face of the earth who does not
know love in some form. World literature is filled with
proof of it. Love makes the world go round.
But just think about it. If we say, `love makes the world go
round', then in fact we are also saying, `love is what keeps the
nature of death in existence'. But that's awful, surely! Is it
really love, the core essence of our being, that keeps the
nature of death in existence Doesn't the Bible say, `God is
love' Perhaps we accept that the way we love is limited and
defiled, but still a caricatural remnant of the original, divine
love, that will change as we walk the path.
No, says Tao _The All-Manifestation does not love as
humans do._ Full of despair, we look at each other and say,
`Where did we go wrong, then' That question has been
asked throughout the ages, and we must ask it too `Where
did we go wrong' Should our love be sexless or something
Should we make it more universal, or more cultivated
No, says Tao _The All-Manifestation does not love as
humans do._ And hearing that, all your conceptions about life
and the world crumble, and you feel utterly confused.
What must you do then Nothing! The essence of your
being is as it is, and you cannot do otherwise than react to it
in whatever way determined by your psychological makeup.
Any attempt to block your innate psychological processes
would simply put you in an impossible position. The more
normal your behaviour in this respect, as an entity of this
nature, the better and more pure it will be. But that does not
detract from the fact that Tao does not love as humans do!
So only one conclusion remains, that when the Bible
speaks about love and says, `God is love', it must mean


```
THE ALL-MANIFESTATION DOES NOT LOVE AS HUMANS DO
```
something entirely different from what we think it means.
Divine love is not super-universal or sexless, or anything like
that. It is something quite different. Let us try to explain.

In the second chapter of the Tao Te Ching it is said that beauty
always brings forth ugliness. We explained that the presence of
ugliness is the proof that beauty in this nature-order is an
illusion, and that the reality of beauty is not to be found here.
Similarly, one can also say that love, as we know it, brings forth
hate. Hate is the proof that love is an unknown quantity whose
reality is not to be found in this world. Our conceptions of it are
a delusion.
The Bible tells us that love triumphs over all things; love
liberates; love is the greatest power in the world. This idea has
been taken as the theme of countless novels. There are people,
families and groups without number who have made the
words, `love above everything' their motto, and put it into
practice in their lives. In the course of time, this manifestation
of love has grown so formidable in its scope, so cultivated and
organised, that the vibration and power unleashed by it should
surely have liberated our world long ago, and elevated it to the
level of a divine heaven. For surely no one would admit that
love as we know it is a lie, a deception
But this love has not liberated the world. Beauty brings
ugliness to the surface, and good brings forth evil, love brings
forth hate. Love is an ember, hatred is a fire. Earthly expres-
sions of love are attempts of the ego to maintain itself. They are
an attempt of the ego to make its own state of being divine. That
is why they arouse antitheses. Where you have embers, you will
also have fire!
There are temples and centres where many people sit and try
to send out loving thoughts and forces in order to elevate
humankind, to protect it from harm and put an end to wars.


```
THE ALL-MANIFESTATION DOES NOT LOVE AS HUMANS DO
```
But in reality, these temples and centres are the breeding
grounds of war, arousing and propagating hatred.
When people are loving towards you, you are pleased.
When they approach you with hatred, you will be on your
guard. Natural life oscillates between these two extremes.
Love and hate keep each other going. If you say, `But I do not
hate. Hatred is unknown to me', we have to tell you that you
_do_ know hate; you could not do without it. Just as human love
possesses a scale of vibrations with many gradations, so it is
with hatred. You have your sympathies and your antipathies.
Antipathy is spontaneous aversion, and it is a form of hatred.
It is the opposite of sympathy, and hence the opposite of the
emotion of natural love. Every day you can observe how you
experience resentment, or behave in an irritable way because
of feelings of indignation or some imagined injustice. At our
conference centres you are sometimes together with a few
hundred fellow-pupils. Yet there are those among them who
deliberately avoid even glancing at each other. You have your
indifference and your irritability. These are the antitheses of
love.
If you observe the totality of your behaviour, you will
know that nothing human is unfamiliar to you. Hatred can
blaze up in fierce tongues of flame, but it can also take the
form of a gently smouldering fire. And though, in this nature,
you may be able to extinguish the fiercest flames, you will
never put out the smouldering embers. As long as love is
necessary in this nature, hatred will be its twin brother. There
is no way around it! Anyone who cultivates love is also culti-
vating hatred; that is a law. Hatred is a means of protection in
the nature of death, as essential and as I-central as love. The
scales of love and hate are constantly in motion and can never
be brought to a standstill. One moment your are amiability
itself; the next the scales tip the other way. Look, and you will


```
THE ALL-MANIFESTATION DOES NOT LOVE AS HUMANS DO
```
see this oscillation happening all the time; it is an amazing but
inescapable aspect of human nature. What wretches we are,
consumed by love and hate. These two mighty fires are the hell
into which we have been cast. Alternating one with the other,
our love and our hatred in their many forms constantly add fuel
to the flames of our hell. Do you now see why Tao does not
take part in all that
You cannot imagine a hatred-propagating Gnosis but, by
the same token, neither should you imagine a love-
propagating Gnosis. The Gnosis loves you, but not in
keeping with your dialectical interpretation of the word. _The
All-Manifestation does not love as humans do,_ and sees all
such perceptions as `straw dogs', which in ancient China
were used for sacrifices. In the same way, neither does the
sage who participates in the All-Manifestation love as
humans do; he sees the people as straw dogs, as animals.

So what does the Bible really mean when it says that `God is
love' Well, it means something quite different, and if you
want to understand anything at all about it, you will need to
free yourself of all your preconceptions about love. You must
shatter them, just as you must shatter all the other preconcep-
tions that populate your pantheon.
The divine manifestation is governed by a certain rhythm,
which is present even in the minutest atom. This state of being
knows no antitheses, it casts no shadows, and always brings
forth itself. Good is not set against evil there, nor beauty
against ugliness, nor love against hatred, nor reality against
delusion. The Gnosis does not have love; it does not radiate
love; it _is_ love! In other words, divine love is not something
which has to be aimed at any goal; it does not know conflict; it
does not make any effort. It simply _is,_ in itself. That is why its
power is boundless, and can be compared with a bellows.


```
THE ALL-MANIFESTATION DOES NOT LOVE AS HUMANS DO
```
If a bellows is pumped rhythmically, it generates a great
deal of power. In the same way, the rhythm of the All-
Manifestation generates an enormous power and nothing
that conflicts with that rhythm can ever enter it.
Knowing this, you will understand better than ever before
why the nature of death is so fundamentally irreparable, and
you will resolve to waste as few words as possible on that
hopelessness. You will not argue with people who do not
understand. You will leave the world for what it is. In com-
plete self-control and genuine service to God, you will focus
only on that which is capable of assimilating the divine
rhythm and which is of the same nature the wondrous atom,
the rose of the heart, the Kingdom not of this world.

## 6 The spirit of the valley never dies

The spirit of the valley is the symbol of the heart-sanctuary,
the centre of the microcosm. She is the mystic Mother, the
rose-bud, the primordial atom. This idea is not an invention of
ours; it is often used in the Bible, too. For instance, it appears
very clearly in Ezekiel, chapter 3, where it says `So I arose
and went forth into the valley and, lo, the glory of the Lord
stood there, like the glory which I had seen beside the river
Chebar'. Chebar is the aorta, so the meaning of these words is
clear. And if you look more closely at the Bible, you will find
this imagery repeated time and time again. Elsewhere in the
book of Ezekiel, the valley of dry bones is mentioned. When
the prophet goes down into this valley, he sees how true life is
quite dead, and how it can be restored through divine power.
The valley-spirit never dies. All who possess a rose-bud, a
primordial atom, bear immortality within them. The spirit of the
valley is a Seven-Spirit, just as the primordial atom, too, is
sevenfold.
The Universal Doctrine explains that the heart is the most
important organ in the body. The heart is called `the king of the
body'. With care, the heart can stay alive for quite some time
after the death of the body, and the small part of the heart that
dies last is the seat of life. We need to see this dying as the
withdrawal of something immortal. And that seat of life is the
`spirit of the valley'.
The primordial atom, the rose-bud, the seat of true life,
contains mind, life, energy and will, and it radiates fiery,
opalescent, prismatic colours. Insiders know this, and can tell
from the radiation of the rose, from the intensity of its


```
THE SPIRIT OF THE VALLEY NEVER DIES
```
opalescence, whether the rose-bud has indeed opened. If it
has, then God, the spirit of the valley, can speak to us. God
can communicate with us in the valley.
The state in which `God speaks in the valley' also involves
a link with the gnostic magnetic field, a connection with the
new life-field; and the prismatic, fiery, opalescent radiations,
which are capable of turning the whole microcosm into a
blaze of light, interpret to us the essence and the power of the
Gnosis. God speaks to, and in, the dialectical human being.
And it is from this speaking, this radiation, that the whole
transfiguristic reversal is to be explained.
All true healing arises from the work of the seat of true
life, so it is clear why the Tao Te Ching speaks of the mystic
Mother. Just as the mother gives birth to the child, so the seat
of life will bring forth the new human being. Thus the door of
the mystic Mother is the origin of reality.
The new thinking, the new life, the new life-energy and the
new will must therefore be born in the heart. What originates
in the head-sanctuary can never be renewing or liberating.
You need to be aware that when you think or want, conceive
or consider in the ordinary way, even when you have the best
of intentions, it is an activity arising from the ego and its
ordinary source of life. Only in the heart is God revealed to
us, the God of whom Jesus the Lord said `The Kingdom of
God is within you'. That is why the head must be conquered
by the heart.
If you were to want to find the path in any other way, in
the opposite way, you would be following the route of
occultism, the path that will nail you to the wheel of birth and
death. That is why the whole consciousness of ordinary nature
must be surrendered to the God revealed in us, the mystic
Mother.
When Jesus the Lord says, `Behold, I stand at the door and
knock', he means the door in the heart sanctuary, in the valley


```
THE SPIRIT OF THE VALLEY NEVER DIES
```
of life. If you are unwilling to open this door, you are chaining
yourself to this nature. God will not be able to speak to you in
the valley.
The pupil who enters by the one door, the door of the
mystic Mother, will find not only that behind it lies the source
of reality, but also that the manifestation originating there
lasts eternally. This will lead him to certain inescapable
conclusions.
Some people think of `eternity' as being `everlasting time'.
But when we pass through the door of the mystic Mother, we
experience a complete freedom from time and space. We
experience entry into a totally different electromagnetic field,
a hence a totally different life-field. So you need to under-
stand that you possess a _spirit in the valley,_ which is immor-
tal, and lasts throughout time as long as you continue to wan-
der in time and space. It is the God in chains, Prometheus
bound. This God-in-you wants to be your mystic Mother.
And now you know the door to her is the source of reality,
and gives freedom, eternally, from time and space.

The spirit of the valley speaks to you, for it contains mind, life,
energy and will. Perfectly organised, it speaks to you in its
imprisonment, just as the Sphinx did to Prince Tothmes `My
son, behold my chains'. It awakens you to the anguish of your
sinful, wretched existence.
The voice of conscience comes from the heart; it is the voice
of the valley-spirit. And now only one invitation, only one
possibility is appropriate, and that invitation is conveyed to you
by the Tao Te Ching _Enter this stream of life and you will not
need to move._
Do you want to understand these pre-eminently liberating
words Join us, then, on our journey to the heart, the king of the
body, and surrender your biological ego, your animal I-


```
THE SPIRIT OF THE VALLEY NEVER DIES
```
being in its totality, to the seat of life in the valley. A stream of
life flows from this seat, a fiery, opalescent current in which
all colours are contained, but which emits a predominantly
bluish-golden radiance. Plunge into this stream in self-sur-
render. Do not allow the animal ego to speak and govern in
your microcosm, but the divine being within you. Then you
will not need to move.
This is how you need to see it in your personality there are
two organisms of consciousness, an organism you know, that
makes you say `I', and a much mightier one, that you do not
know. You need to transfer the guidance of your system to that
other I, that alter-ego, the soul. You are able to do so. And if
you do, you will no longer need to move. All those exhausting
tensions of life, the whole vast surge of woe and misery will
then drop from you; your problems will be resolved in quite
another way. You, the nature-born ego, will not need to move;
the Other One will act in you.
This should not be understood in the negative sense of
being lazy or letting things slide, but in the sense of the
Sermon on the Mount `Seek first the Kingdom of God' —
which is within you — `and all things will be added unto you'.
You will live and experience life in a new way; you will be _in_
the world, and yet not _of_ the world.
Through the door of the mystic Mother you will enter and
encounter a new reality, and you will belong to the new race
the people of God.



_The macrocosm lasts eternally. It can last eternally because it
does not live for itself_

_That is why the sage subordinates himself to the Other One and so
becomes one with the First._

_He makes himself free from his body and hence retains his
hotly._

_It is because he knows no egoism._

_By his lack of egoism, he promotes his own interests._

```
Tao Te Ching chapter 7
```

# 7

## 7 The macrocosm lasts eternally

_The macrocosm,_ the All-Manifestation, _lasts eternally._
Phenomena within it may well be subject to change, but this
alteration is never a reversion to an initial state. Things do not
have to start all over again from the beginning, as they do in the
world of dialectics. The All-Manifestation progresses, evolves.
Every change that occurs within it is a change for the better, a
progression from one step to another, higher, broader one. Only
in eternity is there evolution.
Underlying this is an unknown, divine law, a law of a
nature-order unfamiliar to us, where the unfoldment of things
is not circular, like a wheel turning, but spiral. A law of nature
creates an order, a combination of aspects and activities. If we
study that order and learn about how the various processes
going on within it are interconnected, and then comply with its
laws, then that order will become alive, active. By complying
with its laws we enter that order, we begin to participate in it,
and we leave behind the former system and its laws.
From this it follows that it is possible, in any state of being, to
shift immediately from one nature-order with its laws to
another, and hence to experience eternity in time, existentially,
in a fraction of a second. One shifts from the time-spatial to the
eternal. And if one does experience this existentially — now,
for instance — at this moment, then naturally there will be
consequences, for every realm has its own phenomena and
vehicles. The vehicles of time and space differ from those of
eternity. In other words, one can belong to the new realm
immediately, but transfiguration, rebirth, must necessarily
follow. Transfiguration is possible only when one belongs to


```
THE MACROCOSM LASTS ETERNALLY
```
a new realm of nature. So what happens is not transfiguration,
followed by participation in eternity, but first the formation of
a link with the new realm and afterwards the great transfor-
mation. Some knowledge of natural science will help you
understand what we mean.
If you are with us so far, we can make another point by
asking a question `Why are the two realms, the dialectical
realm and the kingdom of God, different' Why is the former
governed by the law of never-ending return to the point of
departure Why is it bound to a circular course, to the turning
of the wheel, while the law of the other realm is progression,
continuation and ascent from power to power and from glory
to glory'
The obvious answer would be `Because in our realm we
are separated from the Gnosis'. But by saying that we are
only describing the result, not the cause. The cause lies partly
in the orientation of the consciousness. The way the
consciousness is orientated differs in the two realms. Lao Tzu
is pointing to this difference when he says that eternity _does
not live for itself_
Hearing that, a person might say `Oh, I know that; I live
for my family, my relatives, my ideals; I am sacrificing
myself completely'. Such `not living for oneself' is certainly
wonderful and worthy of respect, but still it is imitation with
the animal ego of the mode of consciousness indicated by
Lao Tzu. The animal ego is an I-central consciousness; it is a
very sophisticated `I am', capable of imitating a great deal of
beauty, goodness and love. But that kind of beauty, goodness
and love is only proof of ugliness, evil, and hate.
In many respects, this is a rather peculiar situation,
because the animal ego very much wants to do good; in many
cases it really does want divine life. The urge towards these
things is, as it were, inborn in it. So why doesn't it succeed


```
THE MACROCOSM LASTS ETERNALLY
```
Why can't the animal ego convert the time-spatial into the
eternal, which is what the occultist believes is possible
The answer is that the animal ego is an organic being; it is
an organism. The personality is an organism; you are a vehi-
cular human being, as distinct from a divine human being.
What is an organic human being He is a mechanical being,
governed by a higher intelligence, although he himself pos-
sesses a certain organic intelligence. The organic, vehicular
human being, the ordinary personality, is able to use energy
and act in a human way — or maybe a divine way — because
of his imitative ability, and because of his origin. Raging
around like a madman, he is constantly brought back to his
starting point because of the law of his runaway condition.
Just as a motorcar possesses a mechanical intelligence and,
once started, keeps going, but can only function correctly
when there is a governing intelligence at the wheel, so the
personality and its animal intelligence can only serve their
purpose if they are under the guidance of the God-within, the
highest centre of life in the heart. If this is not the case, then
the organic human being, the vehicular human being, is at the
mercy of himself, with all the attendant consequences.
It is possible to keep on bringing the organic human being
back into manifestation by means of the dialectical reproduc-
tive process, but if the true ruler does not take charge, things
will keep on going wrong; the human being of nature will be
subject to countless degenerations and will follow a road of
suffering in a realm to which he nevertheless belongs. The
vehicular human being is no longer even a shadow of his for-
mer self. The human being of nature thinks he is the true
human being, and believes he is capable of attaining what is
truly human. He pats himself on the chest and says `I am it, I
am doing it, I want it.' He is continually imitating and expe-
rimenting, yet naturally without any success.


THE MACROCOSM LASTS ETERNALLY
If you take the time to examine what we are trying to say,
you will find it amply confirmed in the Bible, in the Universal
Doctrine, and in myths, legends and fairy tales. The vehicular
human being had a Genesis, a beginning, and a fall, a break-
ing away in self-conceit from his God. The organic human
being has but one, consuming need to maintain himself. Self-
preservation is his biological urge. He lives on death and ruin.
The poor wretch has no choice but to do so, because he exists.
He must live for himself. That is his fate, because he would
perish otherwise. He is in danger. He is not being preserved;
he is preserving himself, because of his nature. And here the
curse of Paradise comes to mind.
There are nations and races who have made this attitude of
`eat or be eaten' into a virtue. If you, too, think and live in that
way, you are on the wrong track.
In the beginning, the personality, the vehicular human
being, was an instrumentarium, created in order to give the
guiding intelligence an opportunity to gather experience, to
perfect the All, to serve the Gnosis. The guiding intelligence
is the true human being, the only God. But the instrumenta-
rium has gone out of control and calls itself man. The vehi-
cular consciousness is derived from a ray of the inner, divine
consciousness. The true divine human being does not live for
himself; he is not a self-preserver; he does not live in danger
and has no need to live for himself. He conforms to the laws
of a different nature and possesses an eternity-consciousness.
He is existentially one with the All, with the All-Manifest-
ation, and is sustained by the prana of life.
Was it a mistake, then, when this only God created the
personality-being It is pointless to ask, because the persona-
lity-being exists in any case. There is a God, a true human
being, and a personality with a consciousness, with an ego. So

what has to happen to the class of dual beings to which you
belong
Well, let us suppose that, through bitter experience, you
have become wise; you have become a sage. What must you
do now The sage subordinates himself to the Other One, to
the only God in him. As a creature, he makes himself subject
to the God in him. In total self-surrender he lets himself sink
down into the valley of life. What happens then He merges
with that First One. the Superior One, the All-Governing
One, and enters into glorious tranquillity. He detaches him-
self from his body, his personality. The beast withdraws. And
what happens now The personality, as an instrument, is pre-
served. It is transfigured. How Always well, very well,
under divine guidance. Perhaps the personality is indeed
superfluous, but what will it matter You are freed from the
wheel, you have returned to your Creator, to your God; you
have been raised into eternity!
You have said farewell to your animal egoism, and because
of that the interests of the divine man's true being have been
advanced. They enter into fulfilment. Tothmes and the Sphinx
are united.
If you are willing to accept this understanding of the
seventh chapter of the Tao Te Ching, you will see how
laughable are the attempts of Chinese scholars to place their
own interpretation on Lao Tzu's words, translating them with
phrases such as `be humble, give way politely, and you are
sure to get your own way in the end'.



_The right approach to life is like water._

_Water is everywhere and exists in all places._

_It flows even in places that men reject._

_That is why the sage approximates Tao._

_He dwells in the right place. His heart is as deep as an abyss.
His love is perfect. He abides in the truth and he does the truth.
Destined to govern, he maintains order. He performs his
actions well, and acts at the right time._

_Since he does not quarrel or contend with others, there is no
guilt in him._

## 8 The sage's heart is deep as an abyss

One can see why chapter eight of the Tao Te Ching compares
the way of life to be followed by the liberation-seeking
personality with water. Water is a sublime, universal symbol
of the power-radiations of the new life. Just as the ordinary
human being lives and moves in the electromagnetic
radiation-field of dialectics, so the pupil who, through the
sacrifice of the self, has established a liberating link with the
spirit of the valley, the God in him, will enter and live in the
new electromagnetic radiation-field.
This is the true, living water, which is poured out over him
and fills every corner of his existence. In this stream of new
power he becomes a new creation, a new creature. He under-
goes a new Genesis, a new beginning. This process can be
compared with the first Genesis, when the spirit of God moved
over the face of the waters and created a firmament in their
midst, for when the living water is poured out over the
candidate he, too, gains a new firmament. It is the new lipika,
a new magnetic system which imparts to him a quite new and
different personality-consciousness. He is again ensouled by
his only God, who works for his salvation.
If we shift our attention from the individual, microcosmic
level to the level of the cosmos and macrocosm, we can see
that the same concepts must apply there, too. For obviously,
the God in us, the true, divine human being, the source of true
life in the heart sanctuary, does not live in isolation from other
human Gods. Just as the earthly human being experiences and
is conscious in the nature of death, so, by the law of analogy,
the divine human being must exist in a nature of life, a quite


```
THE SAGES HEART IS AS DEEP AS AN ABYSS
```
different, divine universe. The life-substance, the radiation-
substance of that divine universe is living water, the pure,
divine, primordial substance.
This divine universe, this divine primordial substance, is not
separated from us by time or distance; it is here and now,
interpenetrating everything, nearer than hands and feet. The
living water is everywhere, and there is no place where it is not.
It is even in places scorned by man. The sage knows this, and
that is what makes him say, in the words of Psalm 139

_If I ascend to heaven, thou art there!_

_If I descend into the realm of the dead, thou art there!_

_If I take the wings of the morning and go and dwell in the
uttermost parts of the sea, even there thy hand shall lead me,
and thy right hand shall hold me._

_If I say 'Let darkness cover me' , the night shall be a light about
me; even the darkness is not dark to thee. The night is a bright
as the day, for darkness is as light with thee._

Now what we are telling you about here, what we are inviting
you to share in, is very much an aim of the Rosycross. We are
expressing these ideas in the language of the ancients, using
the words of the Tao Te Ching as a guide, but our activity
among you is as ultra-modern as can be. Though in keeping
with the most ancient tradition of all, it is utterly contempo-
raneous. For what are we suggesting Nothing else, surely,
than reunification with your divine Other One We are invit-
ing you to celebrate a marriage, a spiritual marriage with the
spirit of the valley, the spirit of the primordial atom, the rose.


```
THE SAGE'S HEART IS AS DEEP AS AN ABYSS
```
Is this any different from the alchemical wedding of Christian
Rosycross, as described by Johann Valentin Andreae The
rosebud in the heart-sanctuary, the true seat of life, the spirit in
the valley — _that_ is your bride or bridegroom. And whatever
your point of view as regards gender, that spirit is saying to you,
in the words of Revelation 22, which are pure, Rosicrucian
words

_The spirit and the bride say Come!
And let him who is thirsty come.
Let him who desires take the water of life without price._

Without price! But the condition is thirst! From a desperate
inner need, arising from experience, your soul must begin to
thirst. That thirst is yearning for salvation `My soul thirsts for
you', as it says in Psalm 63.
And we can also think of the words of Isaiah chapter 55
`All you who suffer thirst, come to the waters, and you who
have no money, come, buy and eat. Yes, come, buy and eat
wine and milk, without money and without payment. Why do
you spend your money on that which is not bread, and labour
for that which cannot satisfy Hearken to me, that you may
eat what is good and delight your soul in plenteousness.
Incline your ear and come to me, that your soul may live, and
I shall make with you an eternal covenant. [...] Instead of the
thorn, the cypress shall spring up; instead of the brier, the
myrtle shall flourish.' What astoundingly beautiful imagery!

No priest — nor any Spiritual School — can stand between you
and the valley-spirit, between you and the God in you. That
covenant must be forged by you yourself, in self-authority, and
the Spiritual School is there to help you in whatever way


```
THE SAGE'S HEART IS AS DEEP AS AN ABYSS
```
it can. The School possesses a powerfield, which is filled with
the living water, and its purpose is to amplify that call of your
only God, which is expressed in the words `Incline your ear to
me'. The School tries to be a guide to your animal-ego. Lost
and wandering as you are, it wants to lead you back to true
happiness. At the same time, in group unity, as a Living Body,
the School actually constitutes a mighty, magical aid to
reaching the goal. So if, now, you have reached maturity and
are weary of strife, you are free to reach for that absolute hap-
piness. And when you do so, the stream of living water will
flood over you from that moment onwards. Thus you will
become wise, so wise that others will be able to comfort and
warm themselves in the light of your glory. You will become a
light on the path, in the service of the Brotherhood, helping the
straying and the lonely to find their Lord. That is how the sage
approximates Tao.
The eighth chapter continues with a more detailed
description of the approach to life of the person in whom this
connection has been established. This approach could be cal-
led `the way of life of the living water'

_The sage dwells in the right place_

Since he is linked with the truth, he is always orientated
towards the goal and is always in the right place. The sage is
the truly serving brother or sister, and living in the right place
also means that, when such a servant appears in the life of a
seeker and tells of his truth, it will always be at precisely the
right moment. Not too early, not too late, but always just in
time!
There may have been times when you heard liberating
words but they made no impression on you. In that case,
there will have been others for whom the words were in-


```
THE SAGE'S HEART IS AS DEEP AS AN ABYSS
```
tended, and who really did hear them from within. Yet one
day, sooner or later, you too will hear in the right way, and
then — at the right time — you will recognise the servant,
_your_ servant. Then, for you, he will be, he will live, in the
right place, and you will be able to enter the temple-dwelling
as a welcome guest.

_The sage's heart is as deep as an abyss_

This means that in the sage there gradually matures a perfect
understanding — great in its compassion and unfathomable in
its love — of each individual's state of sin, each person's
boundless misery. This does not mean that the servant of the
Brotherhood becomes a father-confessor whose heart is just a
vast repository for anything and everything people want to get
rid of. Neither does it mean that he is supposed to sit down
and lend an ear while you pour out your whole life-history as
a mortal soul, for one life-story is much like any other. The
details may differ, but the beginning and the end are the same.
No, when we say that the sage's heart is fathomless, we mean
that when one enters the valley of the heart to meet the spirit,
the entire robot-like state of being falls away. And because of
that, the sage does not judge any mortal by the sins he has
committed, but by his true thirst.
He who thirsts, receives the water of life freely. That is a
magnetic law. He who has become pure in this way possesses,
as his signature, a heart of fathomless depth. That is why his
love is perfect. It is rooted in the new radiation-field, and
emanates from there. That kind of love can never generate
hate or vengeance. It is a love that has accompanied fallen
man for an unimaginably long time, through thick and thin,
never forsaking him. It goes out to `save that which is lost'.
And if you do not want to be saved now, but you do in a thou-


```
THE SAGE'S HEART IS AS DEEP AS AN ABYSS
```
sand years' time, then after those thousand long years of woe
you will still see that same love waiting for you. Then, too, you
will hear the call `Come unto me all who are weary and heavy-
laden, and I will give you rest'.

_He abides in the truth and he does the truth_

It is easy to understand that the sage is someone who abides in
the truth and lives by it. Truth is a life-field. Do you see that
this is why a dialectical human being can never be true; why
dialectical truth is always a lie Just as ugliness proves the
delusion of what you call beauty, and goodness and love are
displaced by the reality of antitheses, so it is with what people
ordinarily call truth. You may think someone is truthful and
honest, but all that really means, sadly, is that they are trying
to be truthful and honest, and do not consciously, deliberately,
tell lies. That kind of truth has no foundation in the Gnosis, in
the All-Manifestation, in the God in us. That is why it is
speculative, partial; it arouses confusion, dispute and conflict;
it makes war. Fierce insistence on that kind of truth can cause
the greatest misery, and tomorrow it may turn out to have
been quite untrue.
Someone who abides in the Gnosis, however, abides in
divine truth. That truth is a vibration, a state of being, from
which the sage lives and is. Does he deposit this truth in the
midst of this dark world Only in a certain sense! He vibrates
in that truth, he radiates it.
If you seek truth in the sense of the Rosycross, there will
come a moment during your search for Tao when you taste
and recognise the radiation of that truth. Only then will it
really be possible to talk to you about it. As for the rest, do
not think the sage will enter into disputes with you about
what truth really is. If someone proves to be insusceptible, as


```
THE SAGE'S HEART IS AS DEEP AS AN ABYSS
```
yet, to a certain ray of truth, the sage will never argue with him.
He will withdraw, creating a vacuum.

_Destined to govern, he maintains order_

The sage's life is ordered by the laws of the living field of the
living truth. A sage is a servant of the Brotherhood, and in his
ministry as servant he has to gather together people who are
seeking. If he is to succeed, he will need to create a certain
order in his field of work; his work will need to follow a sys-
tem. This system can be spoken about and discussed, and it is
founded on love, truth and Gnosis, the spiritual laws of the
Brotherhood.
All who are seeking are welcome, but there are also those
who are determined to act against the spiritual order. The sage
will try to help them and put them on the right track, but if it
still proves impossible for them to understand the radiation of
the field of the living truth, the sage will let them go for the
time being, and love will wait for them until they have made
enough progress to be able to move a step further. In other
words, spiritual laws are irrefutable and therefore they simply
cannot be opposed; it is all or nothing.

_The sage performs his actions well, and acts at the right time_

These virtues, like the others, need not amaze us. If you do not
live in the robot-consciousness any longer, but participate in
the consciousness of the Gnosis, you gain the ability to act in a
new way, which is attuned in every detail to the essence of the
holy work, to Tao.
If we look at these gifts of grace in the light of Paul's words,
you will perhaps understand them even better. Paul often
mentions in his letters that it is not his intention to glorify
himself, and he says `Not I, but Christ in me'.


```
THE SAGE'S HEART IS AS DEEP AS AN ABYSS
```
So we have tried to shed some light on the way of life of the
sage who is following the path of liberation. It is our daily
prayer that you, too, may walk this path.

```
See the path — Tao.
Follow the path — Te.
Understand the path — Ching.

Tao Te Ching chapter 9

# 9

## 9 Do not touch the filled vase

The translation of chapter nine of the Tao Te Ching seems to
have given sinologists a great deal of trouble. This can be
attributed to their lack of any key to the true meaning of Lao
Tzu's words.
One translation reads `It is better to carry no vase at all,
than to carry a filled vase on both sides' — an absurd
rendering if one accepts that the Chinese text is referring to a
water-vessel. The ancients did not have water mains, so filled
water-jugs must have been essential to them. Therefore they
would surely have been only too eager to carry them, trying
not to spill a single drop of the much-needed fluid. Another
translator saw the significance of this point about spilling the
water, and put forward the following translation `He who
fills a vase to the brim and tries to carry it along with both
hands, will spill it'.
Having seen what the previous chapters of the Tao contai-
ned, we realise that Lao Tzu must have meant something
quite different. The difficulty for translators is that, in fact,
the Tao Te Ching cannot be translated. The alphabet we use
today is fixed, and enables us to look at a combination of let-
ters and know exactly what the word is and what it means.
But the ancient Chinese pictograms in which the Tao Te
Ching was written down are not like that. Take the word
`tree' for instance. A modern author can write `I see a tree',
and although we may not know what kind of tree, we know it
is a tree he can see. But the ancient Chinese pictograms, even
more so than Hebrew, for instance, carried a variety of mean-
ings, at least seven, in fact. And a Chinese person of any


```
DO NOT TOUCH THE FILLED VASE
```
standing had the freedom to add his own nuances to a character,
after he had painted its basic shape on parchment or silk.
So without a formula, without a method, ancient Chinese
characters are virtually a secret code. In practice, owing to
the needs of commerce and social intercourse, people
adopted the habit of using the same characters to represent
particular concepts simply so that, if a person wasn't there
to speak to, it would be possible to communicate by letter.
Even so, the sender and receiver always needed to know in
advance the meaning of the characters being used. That is
why, although many words in ancient Chinese can be read,
many more cannot, as a result of which the context is lost.
And in any case, the language of the ancient Chinese Bible
was not intended for sinologists who might possibly wish to
translate it at some later date. Their translations differ hope-
lessly, and no wonder. The Tao Te Ching was intended
solely for pupils on the transfiguristic path, and the author
knew for certain, even though he wrote thousands of years
ago, that a servant of the Brotherhood, even though only a
beginner, would be able to read the Tao Te Ching quite
easily untold years later.
`How is that possible' you may ask. `You don't know any
Chinese, and even if you did, surely you would be faced with
the same difficulties as the sinologists'
The answer is really quite simple. Throughout all ages, the
Universal Brotherhood has designed its words, whether
spoken or written, to appeal to the imaginative consciousness
of those who are inwardly ready to understand them. In every
line of such language lies a key which, if the reader is able to
identify and understand it, easily unlocks the rest of the
meaning. If the reader is not able to identify the key, he will
understand nothing and will not be able to translate the true
meaning, even if he is the most educated person of all time.


```
DO NOT TOUCH THE FILLED VASE
```
Here, too, the biblical words apply, that what remains hidden
from the wise and learned of ordinary nature is revealed to the
children of God (Matthew 1125).
We do not think it is pride that makes us say `we are chil-
dren of God'. You are, too; you also possess that childship.
Some people are rather more conscious of this than others, but
we are all equal, and perfection is waiting for every one of us.
So now let us try together to find the key to chapter nine,
guided by our awareness of being children of God.
The first thing we notice is that chapter nine opens with a
reference to some kind of filled vase or vessel. All translators
are in agreement on that point. They also agree that there is
something one must definitely not do with that vase.
Now what does a vase contain Water, of course. So one
translator concludes that what one must not do is spill any
of the water. `That's true,' says another, `but such a vase is
heavy, so it would be better not to carry it.' `Of course one
must not spill the water; that is clear, but in my opinion
Lao Tzu meant that it is not possible to hold on to the vase
and fill it at the same time.' `Well, we can do that
nowadays, of course, because all we need to do is turn on
the tap, but the ancients did not have any water mains.'
`Yes, but they did have waterfalls.'
And so the discussion continues. But where does it lead
Nowhere, because everyone has overlooked the key. But the
part of your mind that thinks in pictures will have absorbed the
key long ago, for the image of the filled vessel or vase is very
familiar to you.
We see before us a seventeenth-century Rosicrucian sym-
bol. A sage, old and grey, sits in a chamber in a tower. Three
steps lead into it, bearing the words `the steps to wisdom'.
When we climb these three steps leading into the tower-room,
we notice that the entrance is flanked by two pillars, and our


```
DO NOT TOUCH THE FILLED VASE
```
attention is drawn by the aphorism inscribed on the right-hand
pillar. It says `Stay close to the vase to make its colours
known'.
In Isaiah chapter 52 we read these words `Depart, depart,
go out thence, touch no unclean thing; go out from the midst
of her, purify yourselves, you who bear the vessels of the
Lord.' In Acts chapter 10 we read of a very unholy vessel
descending from the heavens. In his second letter to Timothy,
Paul says `If any one purifies himself from what is ignoble,
then he will be a vessel for noble use, consecrated and useful
to the Lord.' (2 Timothy 221). We also remember the many
symbolic stories about the grail-cup, open like the calyx of a
lily, and we hear Lao Tzu say _Do not touch the filled vase._
And now we know that is the key! The child of God
possesses a filled vase, the seven-petalled rose, the seven-
petalled calyx of the lily, the grail-cup of the heart. The
child of God _is_ a child of God precisely because he
possesses that holy cup. It constitutes the entire Kingdom of
God in us; a whole universe is contained within the
primordial atom. In that atom lies the All.
However, the dialectical self presents an extreme danger as
far as these things are concerned. Your ego is not the child of
God; your dialectical consciousness has nothing to do with it.
Your ego is a robot-consciousness, quite incapable of
liberation. You occupy a microcosm in which the divine being
lies enclosed, and the Tao Te Ching says to you `Please keep
your fingers off that filled vase!' The grail-cup is filled with
the blood of the lamb, with the pure, living water, and not one
drop of the unholy nature may be added to it. So do not go
near it; keep your distance, in absolute self-surrender. Please
refrain from saying `I' — with the emphasis on the I — `am a
child of God'. You are only very close to the child of God. It
is in the same microcosm as you. The Other


```
DO NOT TOUCH THE FILLED VASE
```
One was there long before you, and will be there long after.
You must diminish and the Other One must increase. Do not
touch the filled vase of the Lord! You, with your mystical or
occult delusion, must not lay hands on the holy vessel. This
grail-cup contains the wine of the Lord, and this wine, this
living water, must touch you; it must quench your thirst.
This power must descend into your soul like a sword.
Continuing with the same metaphor, Lao Tzu says _Do not
touch the sharp edge of the blade._ Do not render it powerless
with unholy hands, and do not say `The sword will descend
into me in such and such a way, under my guidance.' Empty
the cup extended to you by the inner Christ; accept it, full of
joy.
Have you never read or heard that the Masters of the Grail
placed the grail-cup in a beautiful temple In a sanctuary
filled with gold and jewels And that this sanctuary of the
wondrous rose was filled with the most precious, glorious
riches imaginable Well, there is such a sanctuary in your
microcosm. `Rejoice and be glad; the Kingdom of God is
within you', it is the new Jerusalem with its twelve gates.
But you need to realise the danger inherent in the ego's insane
lust for possession. Do you want to keep that hall filled with
gold and jewels for yourself You Do you want to give free
rein to your pride of possession as a mystic or occultist If you
do, you will experience all the misfortune of that continued
turning of the wheel, for the new city with its pearly gates can
only descend when the old city has disappeared.
See the way of heaven before you. When the time has
come, and your preparatory work has been completed, and
your new name conceived for the Book of Life, you — with
your whole dialectical soul-state — will need to withdraw, as
expressed in those tremendous words of John, which contain
the key to the path of liberation `He, the Other One, must


```
DO NOT TOUCH THE FILLED VASE
```
increase, and I must diminish'. You will need to withdraw, with
the sword of the Master of the Grail in your soul, having
emptied his cup to the last drop, so that the holy city may come
down out of heaven from God.
Now let us return to the treasure chamber of the classical
Rosicrucians, where we can see the pillar on which are the
words `Stay close to the vase to make its colours known'.
When the Rosicrucians said `Stay close to the vase', they
meant `Devote yourself, as an I-being, humbly and quietly, in
forbearance and self-sacrifice, to the inner Grail, to the city of
God that will one day descend out of heaven'. This is the only
right attitude to have with respect to the `vase' and, if we adopt
it, then there is the possibility that, in the service of the `vase',
we may be permitted to make the holy words known to those
who have gone astray and are seeking. We may be allowed to
make the beautiful, serene colours and aspects of the vase
known, so that seekers, comforted by this glorious promise,
will one day be able to follow the same path.
The words quoted from Isaiah chapter 52 are a call to all
spirit-spark bearers to say farewell to the world of dialectics
by undergoing the endura. `Go out from the midst of her,
purify yourselves, you who bear the vessels of the Lord.' That
is why Paul says that when you follow the path of self-
emptying, a new soul-state becomes possible through the
Grail-cup, `consecrated and useful to the Lord'. And in Acts
chapter 10, Peter undergoes a very archetypal test. The forces
of the reflection sphere offer him the false cup, but when he
sees its contents, he realises the danger straight away and
rejects it firmly. His resolve is more steadfast than ever he
stays close to the vase of the heart to make its colours known.
That is the signature of the Rosicrucian, the servant of the
Universal Brotherhood. He stays close to the vase of the heart
to make its colours known. He, himself, will never take the


```
DO NOT TOUCH THE FILLED VASE
```
credit for this. Though he has become immeasurably rich, he
will never indulge in pride on account of it, because _he who is
proud of his wealth will suffer misfortune._ Pride is showing off,
pride is love of ostentation, pride makes concessions to I-
centrality. It spoils the radiance of the vase, making it dull and
colourless once more.
When, through the practical application of the fivefold
universal Gnosis, true riches are gained, then the great work
must be fulfilled. Then admittance is granted to the immea-
surable treasure-chambers of the universal life. Then one
speaks in the plural. Then the words are spoken `You who
bear the vessels of the Lord'. Then we discover that the Living
Body, which is formed by its many members, receives the
same treasures in its powerfield by means of its liberating
magic. What is within us becomes at the same time what is
outside us. Boundaries fall away and we experience the unity
of the universal, in the universal.
In this way, the light is carried out into the night, to awaken
those who are of the night. In this way, in the night, the light is
born. In this way, those who are chosen keep together, to make
the colours of the light known in all their immeasurable
diversity.
But those who do not want to let go of the night are per-
turbed, for they do not want to see the colours of the vase,
and hence they tumble into confusion. From confusion, doubt
arises, and they say `Yesterday you said it was green and
today you say it is blue'. They do not understand that though
the ocean, like the aquamarine, has many colours, it still
remains the ocean. They shun the light, and do not yet have
eyes to see.
Nevertheless, the apostolic work continues, for the colours of
the vase _must_ be made known. The apostolic work is universal.
It goes on in the sewers of the night, as well as in the


```
DO NOT TOUCH THE FILLED VASE
```
bright light of day. It has its origin in the broad field of the
Apostolic Brotherhood, and begins in the thirty-two who dare to
make the attempt to put the work into practice.
The night-dwellers and those who shun the light ask
mockingly, `Where are you now with your apostolic light'
We say, `Just observe coming events, for just as the lightning
rends the darkness and makes people quake and tremble, so
the divine astralis in the prepared serpent-fire canal will make
itself known to the whole body as a heavenly fire. The work
will be fulfilled and the new name made. And when the lab-
our is done, those who performed it will withdraw, leaving the
night to the night.'



_He who subordinates the animal-ego to the spiritual can keep his
will focused on Tao. He will not be divided._

_He controls his vital energy until it is as docile as a new-born
child._

_He will make his inner vision clear and pure and so be freed from
moral failings._

_He will rule the kingdom with love, and be capable of being wholly
wu wei._

_He will abide in perfect tranquillity, while the doors go on opening
and closing._

_Since his light penetrates everywhere, he can be as if
ignorant._

_He gives birth to things and nourishes them. He gives birth
but does not possess. He increases and multiplies but does
not expect reward. He rules but does not consider himself the
master. That is what is called the mysterious virtue._

The more we have studied the sublime wisdom of Lao Tzu, the
more we have discovered an extending range of revelations and
possibilities open to those who truly walk the path in the
transfiguristic sense. Now, in chapter 10, some of the most
striking consequences of the path are highlighted. These
consequences do not concern some future state of the divine
human being, but relate to the present state of being of those
who, whilst standing on the path and fulfilling the law, remain
for the time being in dialectics. This point alone means that the
contents of chapter ten are of the utmost significance for us,
because they are not attributes to be realised in some distant
future, but can be achieved in the immediate present by any
serious seeker.
That is why it gives us so much happiness to be able to
describe for you the type of person we would like to call the
`new Noachite', the person who is travelling in the new life-
field, on a voyage from the nature of death to the new, yet
original, kingdom. Such a person is in the process of joining
the new race, which knows no nationalities and no borders.
He is travelling in the classical and yet so contemporary
celestial ship, towards a new and joyful future. If you want to
take part in this journey, all that is asked is that you put the
lessons you are given into practice and demonstrate that you
are following the craft of the true freemason.

_He who subordinates the animal-ego to the spiritual can keep
his will focused on Tao. He will not be divided._

That is how the mason's craft begins. That is the first step. If


### the kingdom with love 10— I He who subordinates the ego will rule

you are not able to take that first step, you will certainly not be
able to take the next. As a pupil of Tao, you need to give your
animal-ego, in total surrender, to the primordial atom, the
kingdom within you, the rose of the heart. That is your most
important task. And you do it not in devotion to an outer God,
with all the natural-religious and occult consequences, but
with a `Lord, your will be done', before the only God within
you, the kingdom within you. It is with this Johannine practice
that the pupil's path must begin. In the desert of his life, he
must make straight the paths for his God.
Let us assume, for the moment, that you understand this
and are really subordinating the animal-I to the spiritual I.
Then your ordinary personality will undergo remarkable
changes because, in response to your self-surrender, the vase,
the grail-cup, will be poured out over you and in this way a
new soul-being, a new serpent-fire, will be born. The first
thing you will notice then is that your will is able to remain,
and indeed _will_ remain, constantly aimed towards Tao,
towards the path. Why For the simple reason that when the
rose of the heart governs your being and determines your
soul-state, the magnetic status of the new nature rather than
the old nature will be active within you.
If your will, as a magical constant, is to be explained
entirely from this nature, you will still be able now and then
to raise it up so as to deal with new problems in your life,
and even to perform magnificent deeds, but from time to
time the will is bound to show its true nature, its origin. In
consequence, the will is certain to be divided, and that will
cause you considerable suffering. The ordinary will, how-
ever much it is developed by mystical or scientific practices,
can never be liberating, neither for the self, nor for others.
But if the personality-being, the soul-state, is engrossed in
the rose and the inner Christ begins to rule you, if this Jesus


HE WHO SUBORDINATES THE EGO WILL RULE THE KINGDOM WITH LOVE

within you begins to live, then the John in you will be
beheaded. In that state, your will operates in a new nature
and quite naturally, without the need for any compulsion,
speculation or self-suggestion, it remains focused on Tao by
day and by night. Then you are in this world, but essentially
no longer of this world.

_He controls his vital energy until it is as docile as a new-born
child._

Vital energy streams from the head sanctuary to all the
personality's organs of action. Every action requires energy,
which often needs to be in a much transformed state. And
often, for one action to be performed, several different
energy-vibrations have to be utilised at the same time. For
instance, there are actions that simultaneously require the
exertion of the intelligence — and hence mental energy —
and of the feelings and will. Such actions are debilitating.
They wreak havoc in the personality because they often
attune the autonomic nervous system in such a way that
deplorable deeds we loathe are nevertheless done by us. The
energy we waste! The energy we simply throw away! We pay
a high price for it, too, in the form of deteriorating health and,
worse still, by remaining chained to the wheel.
However, if the John in you has been beheaded, and you
have been born in Jesus the Lord, so that you begin to live
according to a new soul-state, you will have control of your
vital energy. The sources and channels of your vital energy
will become as docile as a new born child. `How is that
possible' you might ask. `Surely, even with the best of
intentions, mistakes will be made occasionally, and hence
energy will be wasted' But no. To the extent to which the
transformation we are describing has been realised, energy
will not be wasted any longer. Energy wastage might well be


HE WHO SUBORDINATES THE EGO WILL RULE THE KINGDOM WITH LOVE

possible in theory, but the candidate would simply not permit it.
To understand why, we need to refer to the third verse of
chapter 10

_He will make his inner vision clear and pure and so be freed
from moral failings._

We are meant to think, here, of the seven cerebral cavities,
which are to become perfect mirrors of the consciousness and
its inner vision. The more these mirrors are cleaned and
polished by the new soul-state, the more they will clarify and
purify the inner vision. There are a few observations we
would like to make about this. Perhaps you know about these
mirrors, especially if you have some occult knowledge and
have attempted occult training in the past. But you should
realise that any occult training of these seven mirrors is a
surrogate and a serious abuse of your personality-state. It is
possible through occult training to extend the range of your
ordinary inner vision to all the planes of the reflection sphere.
But what do you gain from it Does it make you any happier
Does it liberate you, even for one single second
The transfigurist does not train himself, and yet he still
possesses seven pure, shining mirrors of inner vision. He does
nothing to achieve them; he does not exert his will in that
direction, and yet he receives them, purely and solely because
he has given himself away in self-surrender to the Other One.
The seven mirrors of inner vision are a faculty, an organ of the
new human being. With their help, the candidate will be able to
free himself of all moral failings.
By moral behaviour we mean everything a dialectical person
does in terms of thinking, feeling and doing. The moral state of
the dialectical human being is always seriously impaired.
Yours is, too. Why is that Are you so bad Are you doing it
on purpose No, it is just that you lack the right per-


HE WHO SUBORDINATES THE EGO WILL RULE THE KINGDOM WITH LOVE

spective, you lack self-knowledge, and you need to maintain
yourself in this world, which in turn means that you have to
speculate. You are feeling your way in the darkness, and the
consequence is that your morality is wounded and impaired.
But when the new mirrors of inner vision are clear and
shining, you will be freed of moral shortcomings, because
you will choose your way correctly; it will no longer be poss-
ible for you to go astray, for you will have but one desire to
reach your true home.

_He will rule the kingdom with love, and be capable of being
wholly wu wei._

Those who are following the path of the rose, by abiding in
the Other One, know that the first steps in the new life must
still be taken in the old personality-being and that transfigur-
ation has only just begun. That is why the Rosicrucians of
former times said that once the candidate had received Jesus
the Lord he would have to be submerged in Him. Knowing
and professing this without any reservation, the candidate
rules his kingdom with love and does not sigh, as people so
often do, `Oh, if only I were out of all this; if only I had
finished with it all'. We are so often overcome by melan-
choly, by the feeling that everything is too much, because the
damage done through stupidity is so overwhelming. But if
you have to row across a raging torrent with only a plank to
help you instead of an oar, you will not complain, but be glad
you have the plank. You will use it with love, and it will
bring you to the other shore.
So the transfigurist does not say, `I can't', he does not
talk about his `weak body', but without conceit he joyfully
exclaims, `I can do all things through Christ who gives me
strength'. He will be capable of being wholly wu wei. Wu
wei means `Not I, but the Christ in me. Not I, but the King-


HE WHO SUBORDINATES THE EGO WILL RULE THE KINGDOM WITH LOVE

dom in me'. He who, like John, has laid his head on the
block and is allowing the Other One to rule, can therefore be
wholly wu wei.


### 10 - II

### The sage abides in perfect tranquillity

Chapter ten of the Tao Te Ching continues as follows

_He abides in perfect tranquillity, while the doors go on opening
and closing._

_Since his light penetrates everywhere, he can be as if
ignorant._

We have seen that the dialectical will is divided and cannot
possibly be constantly focused on one purpose if that purpose is
essentially foreign to dialectical nature. That is why the will of
the striving person of this nature always displays a wide variety
of aspects at one moment it will be aimed towards the new life,
and at the next it will be focused on banalities; at the next
moment it will be directed towards goodness, and the next
towards evil. The will oscillates to and fro between these four
aspects until the time comes when the candidate sets foot on the
path in self-surrender, in wu wei, by not doing.
A new soul-state which belongs to and lives in a new elec-
tromagnetic field then develops, and also a new will which,
because of its nature, is capable of remaining focused on Tao
without the need to force it in any way. In fact, such a will
would be forcing itself if it were not to aim at Tao. As a result
of this new state, one's vital energy becomes docile and one
becomes free of moral shortcomings, because the sevenfold
inner vision has become clear and pure. The faculty of inner
vision is related to the top or nucleus of the new soul-state. It is
sensorially one with the new life and is capable of seeing on


```
THE SAGE ABIDES IN PERFECT TRANQUILLITY
```
that level. When it is there, the moral failings and conflicts
inherent in dialectical nature become things of the past.
Even though transfiguration has scarcely begun and the
person in this state still has available and must use his old
material vehicle, he will nevertheless be able to rule the far
from perfect kingdom with love, and walk the path of renewal
in wu wei — which means not I-centrally — guided by the
new soul-state.
It would be good to clarify what we mean by this `not I-
central' state. The consciousness ordinary human beings know
and possess is by nature egocentric. It has a focus and is
therefore an ego in the absolute sense. It is not possible for such
a human being to imagine another kind of consciousness,
transcending the human.
Even so, another kind of consciousness really is possible.
The consciousness of what we call the `new human being' is
constituted quite differently. It is not I-central. It is funda-
mentally I-less, not in a moral or ethical sense, but absolutely,
for it does not possess a focus. It could be described as being
seated in the microcosm as a whole, a consciousness which is
microcosmically all-embracing.
This microcosmic consciousness develops further, expan-
ding into a cosmically conscious state, and then into a
macro-cosmically conscious state. One can best describe this
state as consciousness in the self, and simultaneously
consciousness in all other things, in all other beings.
Scientifically, then, it is clear that all separateness must
eventually fall away.
Wu wei, or not-doing, is intended to be a dialectical approx-
imation of the new, divine consciousness. This approximation
is advised in order to reduce as much as possible the enormous
difference between the two expressions of consciousness, and
in this way to create a basis for the unfoldment of


```
THE SAGE ABIDES IN PERFECT TRANQUILLITY
```
the new consciousness-powers potentially present in the rose
of the heart. So the I becomes desireless, and does not wish
to be attached to anything. The I tries to neutralise itself as
much as possible so that the Other One can gain the upper
hand. Gladly entering into this process of approximation, we
experience a stream of merciful gnostic radiations that
convey the whole ego into a state of absolute tranquillity. In
this way, we _abide in perfect tranquillity, while the doors go
on opening and closing._
What does the ordinary human being know of tranquillity
In waking life there are a few isolated moments at most, and
those usually come about by accident. Or there is the tran-
quillity of oblivion. After a tiring day before exhaustion
descends upon you, you may sometimes enjoy a few hours of
rest. But usually there are things in your life that spoil your
tranquillity, things like unfinished work, conflicts, anxiety,
worry and fear, physical problems and moral deficiencies.
Also, you become increasingly restless the nearer you come
to the limits of dialectics. This restlessness then becomes a
fundamental part of you and, because of your state of
alienation, you can no longer find rest anywhere. The stress-
curve escalates daily. And in the end, as many pupils have
often told us, `The only time we experience rest is when we
are with others in a temple of the Spiritual School, and we
hear about the kingdom of the Father'.
What is rest Have you ever wondered about that It is
surely something more than just the nightly sleep of your
body, or your time off after a day's work or during the week-
end or your annual holiday, or the freedom from mental acti-
vities modern society seems to think so desirable And surely
you don't equate it with the so-called rest that will ensue
when your life's journey is over
The rest meant by Lao Tzu is entirely an inner state, an


```
THE SAGE ABIDES IN PERFECT TRANQUILLITY
```
essential signature of the new human being, the peace that
typifies the people of God. This state is present by day and by
night; it is a constant condition.
Why are people restless Because they belong to dialectical
nature, which is governed by antitheses, by opposition.
Physical rest does not take that restlessness away. That is why
people are unable to be tranquil. True rest only comes when
the new soul begins to take control in our lives. Then we enter
a state of life which is not typified by strife but by tranquillity.
And that tranquillity does not come only after perfection has
been reached. It comes as soon as the first definitive link has
been made with the inner kingdom, after the first self-surren-
der.
Just as the new will abides immovably in the Gnosis, so the
candidate who has gained participation in the Grail abides in an
atmosphere of perfect tranquillity. He is not perfect by any
means, but he breathes in the Gnosis _while the doors go on
opening and closing._ Such a person is taking leave of the nature
of death and is on his way to the new life. He is a true emigrant.
In that process, the doors of the past are closed one after the
other, and the doors of renewal are gradually opened.
How Does one need to make a tremendous effort to do or
not to do certain things No, _the sage abides in perfect tran-
quillity, while the doors go on opening and closing_ with clock-
like regularity.
Have you ever seen a statue of a Lohan Such a statue
breathes tranquillity; it is tranquillity. Tranquillity and this
person are one. Tranquillity in the world of dialectics is at
best a vacuum in turmoil, and generally means only that the
body is at rest. The tranquillity of the advancing pupil is par-
ticipation in the new life-field.

_If his light penetrates everywhere, he can be as if ignorant._


```
THE SAGE ABIDES IN PERFECT TRANQUILLITY
```
On the face of it, these words are scarcely to be understood, but
if one looks more deeply, they are so unbelievably beautiful,
glorious, divine and magnificent that we are resolved to do our
very best to help you understand them. These words have their
funny side, too, because they turn all the values of this nature
upside down.
The word `ignorance' sounds derogatory to most people.
People have to _know._ Everything must be known and under-
stood, otherwise things will go wrong. That is the motive
underlying all education. Someone may ask a pupil `Tell me,
what is the School of the Rosycross' The enquirer feels he is
ignorant of what the School is. So the pupil brings him into
contact with the School and the attempt is made to alleviate
his ignorance as much as possible. And thus it may happen
that the once `ignorant' enquirer becomes a pupil and starts
attending services and conferences. The School is constantly
trying to supply enquirers and seekers with information about
its task, and thus to relieve their ignorance somewhat — with
varying results.
Is the pupil stupid, then No, he has intelligence by the
standards of this nature, and has had a reasonable education
and so on, but the ignorance of the dialectical human being is
fundamental. It can be lessened in many respects, but know-
ledge has its limits. That is why scientific research is con-
stantly used to try and extend the limits of knowledge. There
are many areas in which these efforts succeed, too, albeit
slowly and imperfectly, since the knowledge gained in this
way is often lost later on.
But there is a mystery underlying the work of our School
because, even though appearances may seem to indicate the
opposite, for we have no option but to approach you with


```
THE SAGE ABIDES IN PERFECT TRANQUILLITY
```
information to establish contact with you, it is not at all our
aim to increase your knowledge. Remember the words of
Ecclesiastes `He who increases knowledge, increases sor-
row'. Now you will be saying, `I see what you mean. I will be
able to gain knowledge in quite another way if I follow the
path.' But that is only partly true. Let us understand one ano-
ther; if we do not, mistakes may arise.
We have told you about the seven cerebral cavities, the
mirrors of the new soul-consciousness, of the inner vision
which is clear and pure. These mirrors function automatically
in the ordinary human being, and caricaturally in the trained
occultist, who succeeds in bringing a degree of life — albeit
utterly defective — to the cerebral cavity connected with the
pineal gland. The normal person is dependent on the senses of
ordinary nature and on the quality of the grey matter and the
convolutions of the brain. His senses — the five known ones
plus two more which are not yet fully active — are for him the
seven mirrors with the aid of which he acquires knowledge
and tries to retain it. Of all the knowledge gained in this way it
can be said, `He who increases knowledge, increases sorrow',
or, `The sum of all knowledge is that we know nothing'.
But could you say of a real sage, that `he has increased
sorrow and knows nothing' Of course not, because his wis-
dom enables him to share in a great, glorious and imperish-
able value.
Scientific knowledge is external knowledge; it does not
give access to the inner core of things. With this kind of
knowledge, we certainly do try to grasp the essence of
things, but we never quite succeed. Such knowledge is
imperfect; it is not capable of being absolute, and that is why
it causes suffering. Hypotheses must constantly be changed
and, time and time again, it is necessary to start all over
again from the beginning.


THE SAGE ABIDES IN PERFECT TRANQUILLITY
But such knowledge will never make us wise. To be wise
means to know and understand totally, right to the deepest
depths. The sage described by Lao Tzu is able to use the seven
mirrors, the seven heads and eyes of the new soul-state. These
seven mirrors can be focused on any chosen object so that in
that same second one will know and experience it completely.
So there are seven totally new and different senses and facul-
ties, the intelligence organs of the new, true human being, the
intelligence organs of the people of God.
Now, perhaps, we can understand these words _If his light
penetrates everywhere, he can be as if ignorant._ They refer to
the displacement of the intelligence organs of ordinary nature
and the development of the new intelligence organs. Initially,
the School of the Rosycross appeals to your old intelligence
organs, because it has to work for you and with you up to a
certain point. You have no option but to approach the School
with your ordinary intelligence faculties. But if you follow
the transfiguristic path of self-surrender, you will need to
become ignorant with respect to that knowledge, and you will
develop a new cognitive faculty, the cognitive faculty of wis-
dom. Then the seven new candles will be lit. You will walk
amid the seven golden candlesticks, holding the seven stars of
the new intelligence organs in your right hand.
Then you will be able to write your letter of living wisdom to
the community of Ephesia, to those who dwell on the border,
and you will say to them, `0 seekers of the one knowledge,
toiling that you may understand, come to the one life. Then
your light will penetrate everywhere and, as regards
everything else, you can be as if ignorant'.

### The mysterious virtue

We would now like to look at the last part of chapter ten of the
Tao Te Ching

_He gives birth to things and nourishes them. He gives birth
but does not possess. He increases and multiplies but does
not expect reward. He rules but does not consider himself
the master. That is what is called the mysterious virtue._

Our task now is to uncover what is meant by the _mysterious
virtue —_ an exceptionally accurate formulation of the state of
being of the Taoist, the transfigurist.
We first need to consider what virtue is meant, and why it is
called mysterious. The virtue referred to here is the ultimate
state of liberation, of tranquillity, of not-being. What is mys-
terious is the way in which this liberation comes about, because
it cannot be grasped by the dialectical understanding.
In our nature, the various stages of any person's development
can be traced in detail, but the development of the transfigurist
presents us with an enigma. The life of a mystic, who
withdraws from the world to engage in a life of pious
meditation, devotion and penance, is quite transparent. It is
easy to describe his life and trace what has happened to him
and why. The way an occultist's life unfolds, too, can easily be
understood by anyone familiar with the occult mentality and
practices. There is nothing mysterious about it. A person whose
intellect has been trained, who goes to university and
afterwards becomes a specialist in some subject or other, is a
person whose life can be known and understood, regardless of


```
THE MYSTERIOUS VIRTUE
```
what specialism he has chosen. The course of such lives follows
a programme, one could say.
The more successfully the programme is followed, the
more eminent, famous and admired these persons become.
They become historical figures, held up as examples to all.
But their virtue cannot be called mysterious; it is a very open,
very clear virtue, and its development has followed a clearly
discernible programme he started out like that — then he did
this — and he became that. All quite clear.
But the development of the transfigurist cannot be traced.
There are results that can be observed with remarkable clarity,
but how they came about no one can say. The way a
transfigurist's life develops is not apparent to the world.
An example can be found in the life of Jacob Boehme,
who was a shoemaker. He cobbled shoes _and_ he fathomed
the divine All-Manifestation. His understanding of reality,
of eternity, was so profound that all the professors in the
world wouldn't be able to match him in a thousand years.
Mysterious virtue, mysterious liberation, mysterious even
for Jacob Boehme himself!
That is the signature. Listen to Paul's words `Whether it is
outside the body or inside the body, I know not, but it is there'.
The mysterious virtue!
Have such entities cultivated virtue, or studied it No one
knows! They do not even know themselves. They are igno-
rant. But their light penetrates everywhere, and that is why
they can remain ignorant. Virtue is present, its attributes are
there, but the way they came to be there is a great and
glorious miracle! Not one centimetre of that way can be
`willed', `mysticised', `cultivated' or `studied'. One must even
remain quite `ignorant' of it.
Is it not wrong, then, to speak about that way Well, there is
just one, very positive thing that can be shown you of the


```
THE MYSTERIOUS VIRTUE
```
path, and that is its beginning. The path — Tao — must begin
with the self-surrender of the dialectical ego to the Kingdom
within you. And if the ego has given itself away like this, what
more can it do It is no longer there!
If such a beginning is made, just watch what happens
next! Time and time again, you will see virtue descending
on the path in all its wondrous glory, and it will be just as
mysterious to you as to everyone else. And it will remain
mysterious, even when you continue along that path. For the
mysterious virtue means becoming one with the other
nature, with another soul-state, and what do you know of
that
High up a mountain you discover a hidden spring. You
strike a rock and the spring gushes open. Can you tell in
advance what course the stream of water will take as it seeks
and finds its way down the mountainside Can you tell how it
will reach the sea
You are living your everyday life and you have your place
in it, in an office perhaps, or a shop, or a house or somewhere
like that. Many people know you — where you live — what
you are worth — what you do for a living. They know your
abilities and shortcomings, and any limitations you may have.
Some of them may have known you from your schooldays, as
a child of average ability. You didn't know much then, and you
still don't, and you don't feel you are in any way special.
Now, driven by inner need, and at the suggestion of the
School of the Rosycross, you are on the point of making the
glorious, Johannine sacrifice of self. That mediocre I of yours,
that many people know so well, brings you to the spirit in the
valley, and in total surrender you empty yourself for the Other
One who must grow in you.
Suppose you really do that. Suppose Mr or Mrs Average


```
THE MYSTERIOUS VIRTUE
```
actually does that. What happens then You strike the rock
and a stream of living water comes gushing out and flows on
its way.
And what then In the eyes of the world, in the eyes of
those who know you so well, you will initially remain the
same Mr or Mrs Average. You go on doing your job, whatever
it may be, and you go on living in the same place, in the same
street. But you are no longer there. You have gone, like the
central character in Gustav Meyrink's novel, _The White
Dominican._
A miracle now unfolds the stream of the new soul-state,
whose outpouring you made possible by your total self-
sacrifice, now flows along a certain course, carrying with it
the `house you left behind'. The result is the manifestation
of remarkable new accents and facts in your life, much to
the amazement of all those who knew you so well `How is
it possible' they ask themselves. Mysterious virtue!
The being who was formerly you smiles and is silent; he
continues with his everyday work for as long as is necessary,
typing invoices, selling merchandise, meeting clients, or
anything else that might be required. And all the while the
Other One is giving birth to things in you and nourishing
them.
How is that possible It is possible because, as the great
sacrifice of self unfolds, it turns out that your animal I, your
biological ego, is really a fragment, a scrap, a spark, a tiny ray
of the great Being of the Heart or, at least, is connected with
it. This gives rise to a certain sensation, a certain experience;
it is as if the old I is observing the whole new development
from a corner, from a distance, as an interested party who
nonetheless exerts no influence on the proceedings. It is as if
the Other One in you speaks to you from time to time as an


```
THE MYSTERIOUS VIRTUE
```
exalted relative `See, brother, see, sister, everything is as it
should be; things are being done as they have to be done', and,
filled with devotion, you bow your head.
The signature of the new consciousness is a totally different
awareness. It is not an I-consciousness but a collective
consciousness. It is the Other One who gives birth to things in
you and nourishes them. He it is who gives birth to them, so,
having reached that state, how could you ever claim posses-
sion of them for yourself
The Other One in you is the builder of the new soul-
house, and you watch what is going on, you experience it,
but you do not possess it. The Other One in you increases
and multiplies virtue. The stream widens and deepens.
Though you share in the results of the work, you do not do
any of it yourself, so how could you ever wish for any
reward What reward would you want What reward would
still be possible
The pace of development gathers momentum, virtue
increases, and the being in which you formerly stood as
lord and master towers miles above the former Mr or Mrs
Average. The Other One rules `Not I, but Christ in me'. It
would be absurd, wouldn't it, if you were to see yourself
as master Never in a million years would you say `I am
the initiate, I am the master, I am the envoy of the
Brotherhood, I have the mandate. Look at me, I am the
man'.
There is one signature by which you can always
recognise people who want to infiltrate your ranks but do
not want to follow the path of the mysterious virtue they
always place the dialectical ego in the forefront, they
always bring their I into things. They are forever fighting a
battle, just as battles are always fought in this nature.
However, if you allow the I to fall silent and follow the
path of wisdom, there will be a growth, a development, a
going forward from power to power and from glory to glory

which (^114)


```
THE MYSTERIOUS VIRTUE
```
no child of man will ever be able to stop. Then, whatever
catastrophes happen in this world, you will rise above them,
and above the orgy of conflict that characterises this nature.
The Kingdom of God within you will open and will gain
dominion over you. Yet its dominion will be imperceptible; no
compulsion will be exerted, because it responds to an totally
different fundamental principle and is of an entirely other
nature.
In ordinary nature one ego rules over another, and there is
compulsion ... indeed, there must be! In the new life-field,
such a thing is impossible! So one day, it will be possible to
say

```
Who are you, brother
Who are you, sister
We are no one!
```
We have departed for ever; we are dead and we live. And we
behold the great and glorious miracle, the miracle people call
the mysterious virtue.

because of its empty space is it of use._

_Doors and windows are made for the benefit of the house
under construction, but only because of their empty space are

but true usefulness depends on not-being, on that which is
immaterial._

## 11 There is no empty space

Chapter eleven of the Tao Te Ching draws attention to some
things it is very important to know about. It deals primarily
with what we generally think of as `empty' space. It talks of a
wheel, a vase and a house, all of which, it says, are only useful
because of the empty space they contain. Our thoughts are
spontaneously drawn to the tomb of Christian Rosycross.
Several maxims are engraved on the tombstone, one of which
says, `There is no empty space'. Naturally, Lao Tzu came to
the same conclusion, because what is really empty cannot be
useful.
There is a manifestation known to us as the universe of
death. Its background, which is invisible to human beings, is
more important than its visible aspects. The immaterial,
invisible side of dialectical nature determines its material,
visible side. The visible aspects have a function and a pur-
pose; these are to be explained from the invisible side of
things. If one examines the functions and aims of things in
the world of dialectics and discovers that everything is
trouble and sorrow, one is bound to lose all respect for the
`empty space', the invisible background underlying all these
things and phenomena, because it is that invisible side of
things which has determined the visible.
The aeons and archons, and all the forces seething in the
`empty' space, the invisible side of the nature of death, know
that the cause can always be deduced from the results. That is
why they do their best to disguise their true functions and aims.
That is why the whole of dialectics operates in such a way as to
conceal the real character of the nature of death. But


```
THERE IS NO EMPTY SPACE
```
these efforts are only partly successful, because all phenomena
must invariably reveal their true nature in the end.
So isn't the masquerade rather futile No, for by the time
the true nature of things comes to light, it is generally too
late to take adequate protective measures. The world is full
of churches and places of worship whose apparent aim is to
meet the metaphysical needs of humankind. But their real
aim and function is to maintain this world as it is, and to
keep from humankind any knowledge of the true character of
the nature of death. If a person devotes himself magnetically
and attunes his whole being to the institution that is
promising him salvation, he will be demagnetised as far as
any truly liberating, gnostic magnetic processes are
concerned, and his system will no longer be capable of
benefiting from them. So you can see how extremely
important it is to study the empty spaces of the nature of
death, for there lie the dangers; there lie the causes.
That is why the present-day Spiritual School never stops
trying to unmask the invisible for you, the invisible that be-
comes visible in its phenomena. The cloying masks of the
reflection sphere are torn aside. The contents of that space
which, to us, is empty, are uncovered. And then you know
what to think of them, and you know what conclusions are
justified.

Every human being stands at the centre of a wheel. Every
microcosm and every mortal soul stands at the centre of an
All-Manifestation. The sun sends its rays to you; all the
heavenly bodies send their rays to you. So you are standing at
the centre of a wheel of fiery rays, and all of them are con-
verging on you _The thirty spokes of a wheel unite around the
hub._
The wheel is the astral light that drives you. You are the


```
THERE IS NO EMPTY SPACE
```
hub of the wheel, because you are the focus on which the rays
converge. Lao Tzu says there are thirty of them because thirty
primary spokes or rays of the great fire-wheel are often allu-
ded to in the Universal Doctrine. There are three major cur-
rents of astral fire, each of which contains a number of lines
of force. These thirty rays do not originate from the visible
universe, but from the invisible, the void, the empty space.
The astral fire is invisible.
These rays or channels gather together all the forces and
possibilities present throughout the space of the fiery wheel
and drive them towards the hub. The wheel rotates around the
hub, and the hub carries the wagon, the existence. This exist-
ence has a certain purpose, which derives its use or uselessness
from the empty space, from the source of energy. That energy-
source determines the quality, capacity and potency of the
phenomena made visible by it.
Having made this point, Lao Tzu goes into more detail. He
says `Think of the vase'. We have come to know this vase as
the holy grail, the great fountain of the heart. In this grail cup
a principle is hidden the rose of the heart. But at the same
time, the grail cup represents the whole heart sanctuary,
which has such an important role to play in the grail process.
No one could deny that the heart sanctuary is kneaded from
`clay', from the substance of nature. It can only be of use to
the pupil if he fills the empty space in the vase from the
empty, invisible space of the Gnosis, if he fills the vase with
the living water of the fiery wheel of salvation. And this in
turn can only happen if the heart has been purified.
People are constantly trying to build, develop and equip
their dwellings — their personalities — in every possible way.
They are constantly preoccupied with the state of the windows
and doors, which provide them with a view, and a way in and
out. So now you need to ask yourself whether or not the


```
THERE IS NO EMPTY SPACE
```
doors and windows of the house you are building face in the
direction of the empty space of the Gnosis. In which fire-wheel
are you standing The wheel in which you are standing
determines what function you can fulfil. What kind of useful-
ness does your house offer is it useful to the nature of death, or
to the nature of life
You are the hub on which the thirty spokes converge; they
are like thirty rivers, fed by countless streams from the empty
space. But in which empty space are you standing
You are standing in two spaces the first is that of time and
space; the second is that of eternity, of omnipresence. So, in an
abstract sense, it is as if you can see two wheels of fire spinning
round you. Towards which wheel do your windows face
Towards which fire do your doors open Which wheel
generated the plan you are following to build your house Do
you understand now that the real usefulness of what _is_ depends
on what _is not_ There is something you are not, and there is
something you are, and what you are not you will have to
become.
You are being something, you are manifesting something,
throughout every second of your life. And what you manifest
determines the immaterial sphere, the invisible space through
which you live. So as soon as you look at the real results of
your life, you will know which of the two fiery wheels
revolving round you is the guiding factor in your life. The
modern Spiritual School is the field in which you are taught
and helped to restore the vase of the heart, the Grail from
which all things must arise, to its proper use, and to build the
house of renewal in the right way.

We want to bring these things close, very close to you. So we
ask you to think of the carpet that you see on the floor in front of
the place of service in our temple. You, as a pupil of the


```
THERE IS NO EMPTY SPACE
```
Spiritual School, are the goal of the Spiritual School. The
School's purpose is to enable you to reach the goal, so you are
the pivot around which the wheel turns. So go and stand on the
carpet for a moment. What do you see now What do you
experience now You are standing at the centre of a circle, in a
fiery wheel. Countless forces are converging on you. Like
rivers welling up from the invisible, the living waters flood
over you. The spokes of the wheel unite around you

_The thirty spokes of the wheel unite around the hub, but only
because of its empty space is it of use._

You are also standing in a triangle. The thirty spokes of the
wheel are now manifested in three main currents, seeking to
fill the vase, the grail cup of the heart, to the brim with living
water

_The vase has been moulded from clay, but only because of its
empty space is it of use._

Finally you see you are standing in a square. On that square
you must build your house, your new home, well-provided
with doors and windows for transfigured souls

_Doors and windows are made for the benefit of the house
under construction, but only because of their empty space are
they of use._

Thus, out of the evangelical wisdom of Lao Tzu, which is
thousands of years old, we can see the carpet of the present-
day Spiritual School arising. Go and stand on that carpet,
brother, sister, and it will guide you to the lands of eternal
freedom. He who can understand, let him understand.

## 12 Sight, hearing, taste

The ancients distinguished five colours, five notes and five
flavours. We identify seven colours, notes and flavours, and
there are other people who perceive more or less than seven.
So it is useful to understand how the faculties of sight,
hearing and taste function. One important point is that the eye
reacts primarily to astral forces, the sense of hearing to
etheric forces, and the sense of taste to the combined effects
of these astral and etheric forces.
This combination of effects in fact forms a building
material consisting of astral and etheric energy-substance.
When this building substance is increased in density and
applied in a focused way, it differentiates into three aspects or
elements, which we could call air, water and earth. These
three aspects correspond to our respiration field, which is the
atmosphere in which we live; our vital fluids such as the
blood and the nerve fluid, which is our water of life; and our
form-manifestation made up of the solid parts of our
personality.
The eye is astrally sensitive; the ear is etherically sensitive.
These two together determine the sense of taste, the kinds of
foods we like to eat and the kinds of foods we are able to
digest. Thus it is through the sense of taste that our life-
atmosphere, vital fluids and physical form are determined, in
the same way as air, water and earth were formed from the
primordial waters or primordial air-substance. Another way of
explaining these things would be to say that the personality
possesses an apparatus with which it attracts and converts
astral and etheric forces, the result determining


```
SIGHT, HEARING, TASTE
```
the personality. The eyes, the sense of hearing and the sense of
taste are important parts of that apparatus.
This is the subject of chapter twelve of the Tao Te Ching.
The way we see is determined by the astral forces we are
involved with. The way we hear is determined by the etheric
forces attracted by the astral magnetic light, and the resulting
sustenance determines our whole disposition. Therefore,
since we live in the nature of death, a conflict is bound to
arise

```
The five colours blind the eye;
the five notes deafen the ear;
the five flavours spoil the taste.
```
Once set in motion at birth, the apparatus goes on functioning
until we reach the grave. Its blinding, deafening and dulling
effect means that the Kingdom of God within us is obstructed
as regards its potential for development. Seeing, we are blind;
hearing, we are deaf. And the result of this handicap is that our
form-being is subject to corruption, to crystallisation.
Every human being knows this intuitively. People feel
threatened in every respect by the great conflict. Their lives,
their health, their strength, are constantly in danger. That is
why they are always experimenting — to avert the danger! But
all their struggling only makes the situation worse because,
whatever they do, it is done on the basis of their blindness and
deafness. Their desires and yearnings, motivated as they are by
self-preservation, disorganise the heart sanctuary. They make
things more and more difficult not only for themselves, but also
for others

_Frenzied rides and hunts lead the human heart astray. Goods
hard to come by induce man to pernicious deeds._


```
SIGHT, HEARING. TASTE
```
What this means will now be clear. Do not interpret it on a
superficial level, but understand that every dialectical human
being has no choice but to engage in those frenzied rides and
hunts in the process of self-preservation.

Let us now go back to what we were saying about the senses
of sight, hearing and taste.
Not for nothing is it said that the eye is the mirror of the
soul. Your soul is the light of your life, and it rules you. It is
the astral fire that gives you consciousness. The eye reflects
your state of being. By looking into the mirror of the eyes we
can distinguish souls of various types. Every state of mind,
every state of soul, every astral stirring can be read in the
eyes. It is generally accepted that what we call light is caused
by etheric vibrations. These vibrations are said to stimulate
the complex apparatus of the eye. Then, via the optic nerves,
they are transmitted to the brain where the impression of
`light' is born.
This idea is not quite right, in our opinion. It would be
more accurate to say that the vibrations of the seven-
branched astral candelabrum which burns in the head
sanctuary are transmitted to the eye via the optic thalami in
tiny magnetic waves. It is these impulses that determine the
nature of our `seeing'. What we see will be in keeping with
our magnetic status. Or what we expect to see will be in
keeping with our magnetic status. If there is a conflict
between what we see and what we expect to see, our system
acts to restore equilibrium between the inner and the outer.
Hence all the frenzied rides and hunts.
The ear, too, is marvellously constructed and as you know
has three main parts a part that receives sounds, a part that
conducts them, and a part that perceives them. It is via these
three parts that the whole world of sound is communicated to


```
SIGHT, HEARING, TASTE
```
us. Sound is caused by etheric waves, etheric vibrations.
Every etheric vibration is picked up by the ear, regardless of
whether or not one is deaf. In that sense, one always `hears',
in just the same way as a blind person always `sees'. Deafness
is a condition in which sounds caused by vibrations in the air
can no longer be perceived. In the same way, blindness pre-
vents external seeing but not the astral-magnetic process
explained earlier.
There is a part of the ear called the cochlea, which contains
an instrument that could be compared with a miniature piano.
It has 24,000 strings, all within dimensions smaller than those
of a tiny pea. All the etheric vibrations coming to us are
intercepted by this instrument and heard in a certain sense,
analysed, and then transmitted to the consciousness with the
aid of minute electrical impulses.
Now what we want to show you is this around you, you
create a magnetic field. This field does not function automa-
tically, but is consciously controlled. The instrument of con-
trol is the eye. By means of this magnetic field you attract
ethers. And the sounds, the etheric currents, that consequently
come to you are assimilated by the ear. The ear then sorts
them so that they can then be applied wherever needed in the
system. The nervous system has a part to play in this, and the
sense of taste operates throughout as a combining factor.
In this way, the eye first constructs and maintains an astral
sphere, on the basis of which etheric forces are attracted.
These are perceived and classified. Then the substance is
inhaled, used the sense of taste comes into play.

When a person becomes a pupil of the Spiritual School, the
key to the great transformation lies in his soul-state, in his
magnetic state. That is why the third verse of chapter twelve


```
SIGHT, HEARING, TASTE
```
says _Hence, the sage is guided by his inner being and not by his
eyes._
The chain of cause and effect we have been explaining
must be broken. See the human being as he is a mighty
instrumentarium within, and a world without, both of which
are in a state of total conflict, even though in many respects
they originate from the same order. Hence the frenzied rides
and hunts to achieve equilibrium. But it is precisely this that
keeps the whole conflict going, rotating wildly all the time.
So the fire-wheel of the dialectical astralis keeps on spinning.
That is why the sage focuses his attention on the primordial
atom, the rose of the heart, his innermost being. He rejects
everything coming from outside and desires only what is
within, in the kingdom of the heart, and by that he breaks the
chain of cause and effect.
From that moment onwards a different magnetic fluid is
drawn into his system. In this way, his eyes will no longer
see conflict in the world, but will only perceive a world in
which he does not belong. Then the frenzied hunts on the
horizontal plane will come to an end. The ears will hear and
utilise other etheric forces, and the sense of taste will
receive other sustenance. Thus the five soul-fluids will make
possible that great transformation known as `the alchemical
wedding of Christian Rosycross'.



_Favour and disfavour are things of fear. The body becomes a
source of great calamity._

_Why do men say this of favour and disfavour Favour is
something inferior. When one has gained it, one is afraid. If
one loses it, one is afraid. That is why it is said Favour
and disfavour are things of fear._

_Why do men say The body is a source of great calamity I
suffer great affliction because I have a body._

_If I had reached the stage at which I had no body, what
affliction would I suffer_

_Therefore, whosoever considers it to be a difficult task to
rule the kingdom, to him the kingdom can he entrusted.
Whosoever rejects the thought of ruling the kingdom, to him
the government of the kingdom can be assigned._

## 13 Favour and disfavour are things of fear

The lust for power and prestige is a powerful spur to action in
our society. The urge to climb the social ladder, to achieve a
high position in society, or in the worlds of art, science or
religion, or in some group or movement, is innate in human
beings of this nature order. They are conditioned to be like that
from childhood on.
Those who have achieved high favour usually occupy pre-
carious positions. They are honoured, but also envied. They
are intrigued against and opposed, not openly, but mostly by
the spreading of slanderous rumours, venomous whisperings.
So, in by far the majority of cases, high favour is a thing of
fear. People in high favour live in the grip of fear, fear of
losing their position, fear of falling from grace. For how
rapidly one can plunge from a position of favour to the
utmost ignominy. That is why the character of such people so
often deteriorates; they become callous, ruthless, hitting out
indiscriminately and unfeelingly, hazarding everything to
hold their own.
We do not know whether you have ever had the opportu-
nity to study all this and examine it psychologically. It is
appalling, primitive, bestial in the extreme. It is worth exa-
mining the type of personality that usually characterises
people in managerial positions, people who belong to the
upper middle classes. They have taken over the cultural habits
of the patricians of former times and have cultivated them to
perfection. They are expert at smiling, and being amusing and
jovial towards their boss's every client, whilst behaving
haughtily and barking like bulldogs at minor employees.


FAVOUR AND DISFAVOUR ARE THINGS OF FEAR
They live well in the better middle class houses. You will
know them, whole neighbourhoods full of them, in their
thousands. But alas, the poor things live in fear, even the
government officials among them, for although their salaries
and pensions are assured, they are desperately afraid of
losing their positions of authority. Their positions are their
kingdoms, in which they rule as kings. And they really do
rule, even when they are at home, ostentation being the
means by which they prove to themselves and others how
lordly they are. In just the same way as countries go to war
with each other, so this type of person will risk everything if
necessary to defend his territory. Fear gives boldness and
courage; fear makes heroes. Yes, _favour and disfavour are
things of fear._ You know this.
It is said that the Tao Te Ching was written in 600 BC. In
fact this gospel originated long before that, and the words
_favour and disfavour are things of fear,_ were just as apt then
as they are now. People have always known it. You know it,
too, just as we do. So what more is there to be said on the
subject Well, in the first verse of chapter thirteen, the Tao Te
Ching goes on to say _the body becomes a source of great
calamity._
That is the point! And it doesn't mean merely that those
who are in high favour and are afraid of losing their positions
work hard, excessively hard, until in the end they become
physically exhausted and can easily be pushed aside. If only
that were all! No, such people unleash a calamity that affects
their personality and microcosm in a fundamental way.
Worry, fear and dread are the sisters of hate. The Universal
Doctrine emphasises that fear and hate are essentially one.
Anyone who fears, hates, and anyone who hates, fears. And
his body, his entire existence, becomes one great calamity,
not only for himself but for all humankind.


FAVOUR AND DISFAVOUR ARE THINGS OF FEAR
In Proverbs chapter 26 there are some words which can
help us to understand these things `Like the glaze covering
an earthen vessel are burning lips with an evil heart. He who
hates, dissembles with his lips and harbours deceit in his
heart. When he speaks graciously, believe him not, for there
are seven abominations in his heart. Though his hatred be
covered with guile, his wickedness will be exposed in the
assembly'.
If you understand what this means, you will know what Lao
Tzu meant in chapter thirteen. The seven abominations in the
heart relate to a condition affecting the personality in a
fundamental way. The heart sanctuary is divided into seven
ventricles. The Universal Doctrine speaks of the seven brains
of the heart. The condition of these organs affects one's state of
being in a fundamental way. Their condition determines one's
mentality and one's whole approach to life. That is why it can
be said that `what the heart does not want cannot enter the
head'.
Once fear and dread have given rise to hate, a sevenfold
fire of great unholiness begins to burn in the heart, and radi-
ates outward via the sternum and the eyes. It is a malignant
fire that stirs up everything unholy in nature and spurs it to
action. It is that fire which makes the struggle for existence
so lethal in its effects. It pollutes the whole of our field of
existence. Hate is the opposite pole of earthly love, and the
behaviour of a person who hates in many ways resembles
that of a person who loves.
Love in this world can be expressed in a philanthropic way,
embracing a large group of people or even the whole of
humankind. Or it may be focused on just one person. When
someone loves, he is helpful and caring, and tries to be of
service to the object of his love. But when hatred arises, the
object of it becomes the focus of conscious and intelligent


```
FAVOUR AND DISFAVOUR ARE THINGS OF FEAR
```
attention, all of it aimed at finding ways to injure him and bring
about his downfall. So someone who hates concentrates just as
much as someone who loves on the object of his attention.
Clearly, this can present a deadly danger. The people who
strive from childhood on to obtain prestige and success in life
are prime sources of the hate that poisons every society.
These people are in fact very sick. Their bodies have
become afflictions to them, and it is clear why many people
who understand something of these things can be heard to sigh
_I suffer great affliction just because I have a body,_ or, _If I
had no body, what affliction would I suffer_
Because if one is an object of hatred — and hatred, like
love, is always intensely focused — one will suffer serious
affliction. And even if, ultimately, one comes out of it
unscathed, it is nevertheless a situation requiring the most
vigilant caution, because one risks being injured not merely in
the social sense, but in a moral, fundamental sense.
Hate is an astral radiation which, if you react to it, for
instance by being afraid, immediately catches hold of you
and links you with the sewers of the reflection sphere. Hate is
an extremely contagious, deadly fire. Because of what he is
aiming to do, a person who hates is very cunning. His lips,
burning with the fire of hatred, are like a potsherd glazed
with silver. If you are not careful, the sharp potsherd will
wound you. So you need to see through the silver glaze. A
person who hates dissembles with his lips, speaking words of
love, sympathy, devotion and concern, whilst inwardly he
harbours deceit.
There is one frequently recurring ploy you should be parti-
cularly careful of, and that is the tactic of isolation. If an
attempt is being made to destroy a pupil on the path and to
break his connection with the Gnosis, one of the main tactics


```
FAVOUR AND DISFAVOUR ARE THINGS OF FEAR
```
will be to isolate him. Carefully chosen strategies will be
employed to bring him into a state of worry, fear and dread.
And you know that anyone in such a state feels he has been
forsaken by everything and everyone. He is isolated, and then
the main attack is launched destruction, or at least an attempt
at it.
Clearly, the lone individual will be seriously at risk, and
such people often suffer injury. This point underlines the
enormous importance of group unity and unification with the
Living Body of the School. Not for nothing does the wise poet
of Proverbs say of the person who hates, that `though his
hatred be covered with guile, his wickedness will be exposed
in the assembly.' In the threefold field of grace of the modern
Spiritual School, every vibration of hatred is uncovered,
unmasked and neutralised. Anyone who participates in the
Living Body of the Spiritual School and who helps to build up
that Body in the proper way will be adequately protected and
will also be helping to protect others. But do take care. `Let
him who stands see to it that he does not fall.' For this is how
the process unfolds
First of all, a person wants or tries to gain favour. He wants
an important position or special concessions for his ego. Next,
worry, fear and dread make their appearance, whether or not
the person's efforts succeed. For it is not only favour that
breeds fear, but also disfavour. So even if the person does not
win the prestige he desires, the results will be the same, and
they can be observed in any social group.
Then, thirdly, criticism comes to the surface — the kind of
undermining and destructive criticism that tears the other person
to rags.
And fourthly, the seven abominations are engendered in the
heart, binding the whole microcosm to a state of utter


```
FAVOUR AND DISFAVOUR ARE THINGS OF FEAR
```
ruination that can ultimately lead to its being split like an atom
— disintegrated, destroyed, by the hellish fire of hatred
burning within it.

Now that we have said all this, the way is paved for you to
understand the fifth verse of the thirteenth chapter. If you
have realised the implications of what we have been explain-
ing, you will be feeling the need for a definition of the right
approach to life. Lao Tzu gives it to us.
_Favour and disfavour are things of fear,_ and they destroy
your personality's ability to fulfil its one true purpose. So you
need to detach yourself from all I-central ambitions and
desires. `Do not seek after prominence, but associate with the
lowly', says Paul (Romans 1216). `Wu wei', says Lao Tzu.
In the eyes of many, a lowly person is merely unintelligent,
unsophisticated. But in reality, that isn't so. Every pupil needs
to become proficient in the fivefold universal Gnosis. He
needs to perfect and purify his whole approach to life, both
inwardly and outwardly. He will then be very humble.
So do not seek favour; disclaim it. Then you cannot be
touched by disfavour, or by feelings of having been humi-
liated. Many pupils keep on saying, `I am not capable of any-
thing; I cannot achieve anything; I am nothing; I am no use at
all.' But it is only their fear of humiliation that makes them
say that. Stop all that worrying. We are all children of God;
the treasure is present in every single one of us. Devote your-
self to liberating that treasure; then, with Him, you will be
free, and it will be as if you were a king. Throw all your fear
overboard. Every pupil is gifted and, potentially, already free.
Be a genuine freemason.
Perhaps you regard it as an arduous task to rule the king-
dom, to fit your own microcosmic kingdom for entry into the
community of God. But it is precisely because of this aware-


```
FAVOUR AND DISFAVOUR ARE THINGS OF FEAR
```
ness of your fundamental unsuitability for any work in the
service of the Brotherhood and your resulting unwillingness to
take on any such mission, knowing human nature and its wild
rides and hunts as you do, that you will be entrusted with the
government of the kingdom.
It is known that all genuine servants of the Gnosis were
quite astounded when they were called to their tasks. They
certainly had no ambitions or plans in that direction. But that
is why they were successful. To the last second, they
experienced their missions as arduous tasks for which they
believed themselves unfit, because of their imperfections. For
there was not the slightest I-attachment to the task.
Nevertheless, they cheerfully overcame all the obstacles.
There could be no fear in them, because they did not desire
favour. And therefore, neither could there be any disfavour.



_Look at Tao and you do not see it; men call it colourless. Listen
to Tao and you do not hear it; men call it soundless. Reach for
Tao and you do not touch it; men call it immaterial._

_There are no words to express this threefold enigma._

_That is why they blend into one._

_Tao's above is not in the light; its below is not in the dark._

_Tao is eternal and cannot be defined by any name; it always
returns to not-being._

_Approach Tao and you do not see its beginning. Follow it and
you do not see its end._

_To be able to govern the present you must fathom the Tao of
antiquity. To know the beginning of the Original means to hold
the thread of Tao in both hands._

## 14— 1 Look at Tao and you do not see it

The fourteenth chapter of the Tao Te Ching draws attention to
a rather weak spot in the transfigurist's armour concerning his
relationship with the ordinary researcher. `Where is that world-
order of yours', people ask. `Where is the Immovable
Kingdom Show me one glimpse of it and I shall accept it and
bear witness to it.'
This is an age-old question. You can read it in the Confes-
sions of Augustine, who asked it of the Manichean Brothers.
Receiving no answer, he left their ranks, to which he had
belonged as a preparatory pupil, and went on to become one of
the pillars and founders of the Roman Catholic Church.
Augustine, who is also highly regarded in protestant circles,
was a failed pupil of the transfiguristic Spiritual School.

_Look at Tao and you do not see it; men call it colourless.
Listen to Tao and you do not hear it; men call it soundless.
Reach for Tao and you do not touch it; men call it immaterial._

Entering the transfiguristic Spiritual School is an uncertain
venture. Do we have anything concrete to offer you as a
starting point Lao Tzu admits it openly in terms of the
reality of ordinary nature, no such starting point exists.
We, too, say that nothing concrete can be proved on the
basis of that reality. If people speak to us about empirical
research and scientific proof we fall silent. For the
existence of the realm we want to enter, the kingdom of
Tao, can never be proved in those terms.
It would be very helpful if you were to impress this fact
clearly on your mind. By all means consider the possibility


```

```
that we might be taking you for a ride. We would not blame
you if you were to leave our ranks on those grounds, just like
Augustine, who left the Manicheans and later wrote about
how foolish they were to believe and affirm what they were
never once able to prove, and what they could only explain
in a very abstract, philosophical way. It would be good, very
good if you were able to understand these things. We cannot
prove the essence and the reality of Tao any more than the
Manicheans could. In the eyes of many pupils we often read
amazement and the unspoken question `How do you know
the things you talk about Why don't _we_ know them Give us
something concrete to go by.'
Recently we were asked outright, `Give me something
tangible to go on. Does your information come from some
book I don't know about What is it called Where can I find
it' We replied that our teachings are never drawn from
books, although we often refer to world literature to illustrate
the points we want to make. It was a vague answer; we were
well aware of that. We said that one can only get to the
bottom of these things by following the path. The enquirer
became rather reserved. We could understand that. He was
full of questions and disbelief. We doubt whether he will
follow the path.
It is much easier for the religious and occult groups of this
nature. The reflection sphere provides them with a rich source
of proof, on which they can draw to provide evidence of any-
thing they like. The nature-aeons furnish those who try to
maintain themselves in the reflection sphere with everything
they need to gain credence. There Augustine was able to find
plenty of what he wanted — proof of another kingdom — like
picking flowers in a meadow. There is certainly no shortage of
reflection sphere brotherhoods ready to help your I-being.
You can meet such masters in any shape or form you wish.


```
LOOK AT TAO AND YOU DO NOT SEE IT
```
All tastes are catered for. They will be only too pleased to
appear before you.
The majority of them are certainly not deceiving you on
purpose. On the contrary, they possess much that is good in
the dialectical sense. They are trying to make this nature-order
acceptable. So much effort they put into it, so much work! It
is only that they are victims of circumstance, just like the
others. They, too, have looked at Tao but not seen it; they, too,
have listened but not heard, touched but not felt. Just like
Augustine. How could they do anything else than deny its
existence, just as he did Could you be blamed if you denied it
as well Better a bird in the hand than ten in the bush.
Countless reflection sphere figures, all of them splendid,
exemplary types, are offering you their `other kingdom' —
that exists, and whose existence can be proved. `So there's no
need to believe what those Taoists or modern transfigurists
say. With us, you can come and see it for yourself. We can put
you in touch with a whole host of accomplished adepts. We
challenge you to produce any transfigurist adept who could
compare with them, just one!'
But there isn't one, not even one! We can only point to
historical figures like Lao Tzu and many others from earlier or
much later times. We can only say that these entities apparently
did not die, because the microcosms with which they were
connected cannot be found, either in the material sphere or in
the reflection sphere.
`Well,' say those who want to oppose or deny, `isn't that
proof enough that these entities never existed Otherwise,
surely all those distinguished adepts would know about
them So what you are saying must be pure fantasy.'
Yes, in dialectical terms, our case is weak in the extreme.
Indeed, no words exist that could express the threefold
enigma of Tao. That was true a hundred thousand years


```
LOOK AT TAO AND YOU DO NOT SEE IT
```
before our era, and long before that. So let us not even try to
define what cannot be defined; _they blend together into one._
Somewhere in his writings, Lao Tzu says that defining the
word `Tao' is like striking a blow at nothingness. _Tao's above is
not in the light; its below is not in the dark._ So Tao is
shadowless. _Tao is eternal and cannot be defined by any name;
it always returns to not-being,_ to an absolute silence. It is the
image of the imageless and the form of the formless. It is an
absolute mystery. _Approach Tao and you do not see its
beginning. Follow it and you do not see its end._
Are these words enough to satisfy the modern person of the
twentieth century You approach and you see nothing. You
listen and you hear nothing. You touch and you feel nothing!
So if you want to belong to this Spiritual School, you will
have to make the choice on your own, and it will be your own
responsibility. In brief, it is like this we are making a pil-
grimage, a carefully planned, methodical journey. We no
longer want to die, and neither do we want to live; we no
longer wish to be found, anywhere. In other words, our
destination lies neither in the reflection sphere, nor in the
material sphere, but in `the Eternal Nothingness', as it is called
by the dialectical world and all its aeons and entities.

If you think all this over carefully, you will surely sense that
behind this Spiritual School there is a tremendous power. In
your own way, you will surely have experienced that power.
Now the most one can say about this, is that it is the thread of
Tao, the thread of Ariadne. How did we get hold of that thread
We will gladly tell you.
Is the thread we hold the beginning No, for there is no
beginning! You do not see its beginning and you do not see its
end. Just like you, we too searched throughout dialectical
nature. We were able to do that because we are _of_ this nature.


```
LOOK AT TAO AND YOU DO NOT SEE IT
```
With our I-being we were able to try and test everything this
world had to offer. And lo and behold, everything was
trouble and sorrow. We found out that this nature is a nature
of death, and we had no desire to jubilate with the blessed
before the throne; neither did we want to strive to make this
accursed order acceptable in any way whatever. After years
of trying and testing, we came to the conclusion that this
could not be the true meaning of existence, and that it would
not be good to go on having any part in deluding people in
the nature of death.
One can draw such conclusions, but afterwards, one has
to make a decision. The time must come when one has to
`govern one's present existence'. So we had no option but
to fathom the Tao of antiquity, not with the aid of
authorities, but objectively. Can such a thing be done
Yes, oh divine rapture, it can, although we soon found out
that on all sides, everything was (and is) being done to
hinder these discoveries. Many sources had been ruined;
others were inaccessible, because they had been locked
away in deep cellars beyond human reach. The rest,
without exception, had been terribly mutilated.
We began with the few fragments of the holy language that
had survived. From these, it became clear to us that there
exists an original kingdom, another order of nature, a realm far
beyond the highest nirvanic plane, a realm quite separate from
the nature of death and its two spheres.
Once we had realised this, we set out to discover whether
there had been people, or groups of people, who had striven to
find that other realm, what their lives had been like, and what
features distinguished them from others. We tried to find out
whether such people, although widely separated from each
other in space and time, had followed the same pathways. We
discovered that the efforts of all these people and groups fol-


```
LOOK AT TAO AND YOU DO NOT SEE IT
```
lowed the same basic pattern. We hoped to make contact with
those who had gone before us, and in our efforts to do so we
exhausted our entire arsenal of magical capabilities — but not
one faint glimmer of the Brothers did we obtain in response.
Now we can laugh at all those attempts, for were we not
seeking the image of the imageless, the form of the formless If
the Brothers had revealed themselves, they would have been
dethroned. They would have been inhabitants of the reflection
sphere. But they had disappeared forever; they had not died.
Countless were the invitations we received during that period,
invitations from numerous brotherhoods `Come and join us,
and give up your useless efforts'.
Then we immersed ourselves in self-freemasonry, because
_he who knows the beginning of the Original has the thread of
Tao in his hands._
What is the beginning — not _of_ the original, but what is the
beginning that leads _to_ the original, the beginning that all our
predecessors had found What else could it be but the practice
of the fivefold universal Gnosis

insight
yearning for salvation
self-surrender
the new way of life
and through it, fifthly,
revelation,
the thread of Tao.
```
Not a communication in the personal sense, but an electro-
magnetic connection with the Gnosis through which the soul,
the wholly Other One, is awakened and becomes conscious.
_That_ is the thread of Tao. That is what it means to be linked
with the chain of the Universal Brotherhood. Anyone who
holds that thread in his hands will proceed from power to


```
LOOK AT TAO AND YOU DO NOT SEE IT
```
power and from glory to glory, and he will be following in
the footsteps of those glorious, divine Brothers who have
vanished from the earth.
Such a person will then begin to invite others to take
hold of the same thread, to follow the same method, to
build with him, according to the design of the original
beginning. And together, all the companions who join in
and take up the thread form a new brotherhood, a Living
Body, and all bear the magnetic sign of the Son of Man
on their foreheads.
The first gift of grace received in this state of being is
the experience of being able to `govern one's present
existence'. Such people have been freed. They are
strangers on earth, travelling to the true Fatherland.
What is hidden to the wise and understanding of this
world is revealed to the children of God.

_He who knows the beginning of the Original has the
thread of Tao in his hands._


# 14 - 11

## 14— II The thread of Tao

```
As we said in the last chapter, the path to the original
kingdom involves the application of the fivefold universal
Gnosis. Those who are not yet walking this path and have
therefore not yet found the thread of Tao often demonstrate
moral disequilibrium and mood swings due to the turbulent
sea of their emotions. One moment they are cheerful, the next
very miserable. One moment they are very purposeful and
positive, the next they are filled with despair and feel as
though they might as well give up everything. One day they
are strong, the next day quite the opposite. We are all familiar
with these oscillations. They characterise dialectical nature.
You can read about this in the works of Chuang Tzu. They
portray a pupil who is earnestly trying to make something of
his life in the sense meant by our School. All day long he
agonises over how to rid himself of what torments him and to
cultivate what he loves, but success eludes him.
Lao Tzu says to him `You must purify yourself comple-
tely, but I see by your sadness that something is stopping you
still.' He then advises `If the hindrances from outside become
too great, you must not attempt to overcome them by fighting
against them, but you should shut your mind to them. If they
come from within, you must not try to repress them, but
rather keep yourself out of the way of temptation. If even a
master in Tao and virtue is incapable of resisting these two
influences in combination, how much less can one who is
striving after Tao.'
Happily, there are many pupils in the Spiritual School who
are striving after the new life. They are trying to make the
```

```
THE THREAD OF TAO
```
essence of the Gnosis into a virtue in themselves. Through
the intermediary of the Mystery School, such efforts always
result in a link with Tao; something of the magnetic current
of the Gnosis is imparted to the pupil's being. The pupil is
brought close to the thread of Tao, and now he is advised to
hold onto that thread, so that he may possess it.
Clearly, any pupil who attempts to do this will find him-
self in a difficult situation, in which the magnetic currents of
two realms are being transmitted to him the current of the
new nature and the current of the old nature of death, by
which the pupil lives. This results in tremendous inner
conflicts. Great, unbridgeable antitheses are felt, and it
cannot be otherwise. If someone is fundamentally of the
darkness, and he is placed in the light, he will feel terrible.
His own darkness will be revealed to him more than ever
before. In addition, his microcosm, in which he is the current
personality, has an immeasurably long past in the world of
time and space, and his blood and his soul are conditioned by
that past. So there is total equilibrium between the past and
the present, and together they determine his future.
This natural process — and it is nothing more than that —
conditions one's whole life and character, and is experienced
by the pupil as darkness, as a great burden, as temptations
that hinder his pupilship. He starts talking about the devil, or
about being influenced by the reflection sphere and so on.
But you need to realise that such influences are always side-
effects, and never first causes. In reality, the dialectical influ-
ences affecting the personality from outside originate from
the other parts of the microcosm, while the influences affect-
ing the personality from within originate in the blood. These
are the temptations from outside and from within.
Lao Tzu advises `Do not fight against these natural pro-
cesses, and do not try to get the better of them in that way, for


```
THE THREAD OF TAO
```
you will never succeed.' As regards the influences from
outside, he says, `close your mind to them,' and as regards
the influences from within, his advice is to `keep yourself
outwardly out of the way of temptation; do not act on
these influences'.
You may not always be able to tell straight away
whether an influence is coming from outside or from
within; whether it originates in the magnetic sphere of
your being or in the blood. But that won't matter. All you
need to do is cultivate the following approach
As soon as you notice that a particular influence is
tending to disturb the steady unfoldment of your
pupilship, divert your thoughts immediately, or try to
dispel the influence by engaging in some intense activity.
Do not give it a second's attention. If the influence arises
from your blood, and all kinds of inclinations are stirring
and boiling within you, just let your blood spend itself and
avoid any outer action, whether in reality or in thought.
If you apply this twofold method, you will notice that
your strength as a pupil will constantly grow, and that
you can grasp the thread of Tao more and more firmly.
If you fail — and there is no reason why you should —
you will find you keep on having to start all over again
from the beginning, which will weaken your body,
increase your burden, and make your life hell.
So we hope you will take this ancient, classical advice
to heart.


_In antiquity the good philosophers who devoted themselves to
Tao were slight, subtle, dark and penetrative. They were so
deep that it cannot be understood._

_But because it cannot be understood, I will try to give an
impression of it._

_They were circumspect, like one who wades across a stream in
winter. They were watchful, like one who has cause to fear his
neighbours. They were attentive, like a guest to his host. They
disappeared, like ice when it melts. They were simple, like
uncarved wood. They were empty, like a valley. They were like
cloudy water._

_Who can purify into peace the impurities of his heart Who can
be born gradually into Tao by the prolonged practice of calm
He who retains Tao does not wish to be full. Precisely because
he is not full he is forever secure against change._

## 15— I The five characteristics of good philosophers

A philosopher is a seeker of wisdom. In the original sense, a
philosopher is someone who strives for divine wisdom. This
divine wisdom is not knowledge in some specialised form. It
is not some baffling, complicated system enciphered in an
ancient, forgotten language, only accessible to the few who
are conversant with its hieroglyphs, and who dole out tiny
snippets of it, crumb by crumb, in modern literature. The
conduct of academics whose job it is to analyse ancient
manuscripts when they are discovered in archaeological
excavations is a case in point.
But no, the wisdom which is Gnosis is omnipresent. It is an
atmosphere incorporating numerous forces, elements and
radiations. The divine wisdom is contained — in a fundamental
sense — in a radiation-field. And anyone who lives in that
radiation-field and possesses a living soul-principle draws from
it not only life-force and the substance necessary for
transfiguration, but also wisdom.
Wisdom is an aspect of the divine life-force, of the divine
spirit of love. When it was said of Jesus the Lord that he grew in
knowledge and wisdom, and in grace and favour with God and
man, this is not a reference to his upbringing or education. It
means that Jesus the Lord grew in the gnostic life-field, and that
this brought about its maturation and perfection.
If you think about this, you will discover how much such a
developmental process differs from development in the world of
dialectics. The maturation and growth of a child into an adult
does not involve the development of wisdom, but only


```
THE FIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD PHILOSOPHERS
```
the development of the intellectual apparatus. People use all
kinds of child-rearing techniques and educational methods,
many of which are essential to give the human being at least a
semblance of humanity.
It is only because of what people are made to learn at
school, and all the things they learn from experience, that they
are able to tolerate life. We do not want to devalue earthly
knowledge by saying this, or to suggest it is not necessary, but
only to compare it with Gnosis. Biologically speaking, the
human being is utterly deficient. So he has no choice but to
resort to theoretical education in order to seem something, and
to survive the struggle for existence. Biologically speaking, the
human system can take in nothing but solid food and the astral
breath of death. And apart from perpetuating his bondage to
nature, this breath gives him nothing at all. When a person
becomes aware of this impasse and is profoundly conscious of
a feeling of imprisonment, then he may become a philosopher
in the ordinary sense, because he will start searching for the
meaning of existence. On the basis of his dialectical state of
being, he will start trying to penetrate right to the essence of
things. But he will not succeed, because only one possibility is
open to him, and that is to apply dialectical methods of
investigation combined with experience.
Suppose there is a book in an ancient language. Some
people find it and say to each other, `This book is full of wis-
dom. We must find out what it says because we want to
understand the meaning of existence.' But none of them know
how to read the ancient language, so they elect one person to
learn it so that he can tell the others what is in the book. The
chosen person then stands before the others as a teacher, but
not a teacher of wisdom, for he is only talking about something
he has read in a book. That kind of knowledge is only an


```
THE FIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD PHILOSOPHERS
```
intellectual definition of wisdom, but it can never be wisdom
itself, because _the_ wisdom is not to be found in a book.
Intellectual definitions of wisdom always tend to give rise
to misunderstandings and differences of opinion, and hence to
the variety of philosophical systems known today. Some
originators of such systems meet with success; their works
become fashionable, especially if they can be utilised in any
educational system, and their career is made. But when you
realise that divine wisdom cannot possibly be obtained in this
manner, you will see how sad it is that all this intellectual
effort is expended to no avail.
Divine wisdom cannot possibly be attained in this way. If
you want wisdom, if you want genuine Gnosis, you will need
to change direction entirely. You will need to start walking
the path of rebirth, the path of transfiguration. This path
involves a death — of the self — and a new birth — of the
rose-nucleus within you. This brings with it a new biological
state, and hence a new process of maturation, which makes it
possible to `grow in knowledge and wisdom'. And that is the
new state of consciousness. With every breath of the new
magnetic forces that can be retained in your system, you will
be inhaling wisdom.
To possess the wisdom which is of God does not mean, as
some people believe, to possess theoretical knowledge
without having studied it. It means to inhale the Gnosis via a
new biological state of being. As a result, this wisdom,
which is one with the breath of life, pervades the entire
being, imbuing it with new faculties.
Imagine how it would be if we said to you `We have a
book here that contains all the information you need to know.
You must read it. But unfortunately, the book is written in a
dead language from the remote past. We are therefore


```
THE FIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD PHILOSOPHERS
```
suggesting that you learn the language, and we reckon it will
take you about three years.' No doubt you would start studying
straight away.
But you can participate in the divine Gnosis with far less
effort and in much less time. If only you are willing to walk
the rose-path in complete surrender, it will lead to your
growing in knowledge and wisdom, and in grace and favour
with God and man. And the result of your complete surrender
will not be that you acquire knowledge you did not possess
before, but that you make use of knowledge and abilities you
already possess, and have possessed for a long time.
You possess the divine principle, the rosebud, in your heart.
If you give yourself in complete surrender to that kingdom
within you, you will gain five new attributes

```
you will become slight,
subtle,
dark,
penetrative,
and deep.
```
In terms of dialectical nature you will become slight, insig-
nificant. In terms of the new nature your sensitivity will
become extremely subtle, because of the new soul-state
developing within you. As regards dialectical nature you will
become dark, inscrutable. As regards the new nature you will
penetrate the unfathomable depths of the universal life and
become immersed in the boundless ocean of the divine mani-
festation.
This new approach to life passes all mortal understanding.
Nevertheless, you are given an image of it, and not a fantasy
one, but an actual, concrete representation of what the new
approach to life is like.


THE FIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD PHILOSOPHERS
The person who walks this path and progresses from power
to power is _circumspect, like one who fords a stream in
winter._ Modesty and circumspection come naturally to him,
for is he not like a newborn child giving its first cry in the
new life-state
He is _on his guard, like one who fears his neighbours;_ he is
alert by day and by night, for, as a newborn child, he lies in
the stable of the nature of death, and is Herod not lying in
wait to kill the child He is a stranger in a strange land, and
he always needs to exercise the utmost caution to avoid being
harmed in that land, to which he does not belong.
He is _attentive, like a guest to his host;_ he is dedicated to the
Spiritual School and its essence and always considerate
towards everyone he meets.
He disappears, _like ice when it melts;_ day by day, he is
undergoing a process of constant change, a clearly de-
monstrable process of practical new life which involves the
disappearance of his former character-type.
He is _simple, like uncarved wood;_ simplicity is the distin-
guishing feature of his life, and ostentation is completely
foreign to him.
He is _empty, like a valley;_ he is free of earthly desires, for
his heart sanctuary has been emptied of them.
To those who do not share his inner state, he is _like cloudy
water;_ he makes no attempt to display his true state of being,
or to radiate his light just for the sake of it. Why should he cast
roses before asses, or pearls before swine So many people
will consider him foolish, insignificant, inferior, ignorant, for,
like cloudy water, they cannot fathom him at all.
It is very important for you to understand that this sevenfold
approach to life can become your own in the fullest possible
sense

modest,
watchful of the nature of death,
dedicated to the Spiritual School and to humankind,

### The impurities of the heart

In this chapter we would like to look at the last part of chapter
15 of the Tao Te Ching.

_Who can purify into peace the impurities of his heart Who
can be born gradually into Tao by a prolonged practice of
calm_

_He who retains Tao does not wish to be full. Precisely because
he is not full he is forever secure against change._

Here are two very important questions, and they need to be
answered in detail. The five aspects, the five states that deter-
mine and manifest the nature of the soul are

```
the blood,
the endocrine fluid,
the consciousness fluid
the nerve fluid
the serpent-fire.
```
These are the five `life-lights', or the five universal forces
from which the soul arises and from which the consciousness
is to be explained. These five soul-forces determine our sen-
sory perception, and they combine to form one unit. How-
ever, one of the soul-lights plays a particularly prominent
role, and that is the blood, which determines the other four.
The quality of the blood is manifested in two distinct res-
piratory processes, one in the head sanctuary and one in the


```
THE IMPURITIES OF THE HEART
```
heart sanctuary. The respiration which takes place via the
brain's magnetic system is determined by the person's soul
quality. The respiration which takes place via the heart sanc-
tuary is the gateway to the soul. The heart respires via the
ordinary breathing apparatus of the lungs, but also via the
sternum, and the respiration of the sternum, too, functions
magnetically.
So there are two magnetic respiratory systems, one which
works via the brain, and one which functions via the sternum.
In between the two is the ordinary respiratory system which
operates via the nose and enables us to absorb forces from the
atmosphere. For the sake of completeness, we should also
mention that the whole body respires as a result of this twofold
magnetic system, absorbing astral fluid via the liver and ethers
via the spleen.
The brain's magnetic system functions automatically,
although it can be influenced by the will. However, the
modern Spiritual School advises strongly against this, because
to try it would be to set foot on the slippery slope of
occultism. Instead, the pupil is advised to influence the mag-
netic system of the sternum, not by means of the will, but with
the boundless desire for salvation that has arisen in him as a
result of insight and experience.
So now we can see the significance of the question _Who
can purify into peace the impurities of his heart_ All desires
are radiated by the sternum, and all reactions to them are
absorbed by the sternum. So the sternum is like an open
book. Everything that enters your system in this way
determines the nature and vibratory level of your blood. And
the state of your blood at this moment regulates what is
assimilated by the magnetic system of the brain, as well as
the quality of the other life-lights. All this in turn causes the
magnetic flames of desire to emanate from the sternum.


THE IMPURITIES OF THE HEART
So now you can see why there are so many impurities in
the heart sanctuary, and how they spread from there
throughout the human system and out into the external
environment. True peace, genuine tranquillity of the soul, is
the distinguishing feature of the new human being, but it is
impossible as long as the sternum is controlled by all those
ordinary emotions that characterise the dialectical state of
life. The fivefold soul of the dialectical human being is never
at rest, because of its very nature. The fundamental
restlessness of the dialectical universe, the hostility of nature,
anxiety, worry and fear, joy and sorrow, the struggle for
existence — these things race through the soul in quick
succession; they constitute the nature of the soul. That is why
the soul needs tranquillity; it needs equilibrium, stillness.
Everyone yearns for these things, because tranquillity of soul
is health-giving. The constant restlessness of the soul is the
cause of illness and death, and of every regretted deed in our
lives. He who finds tranquillity finds health.
Do you now understand why people talk about `care of the
soul', and why they have devised so many methods of soul-
care People will do anything and everything to attain inner
peace, to forget about their troubles for a while, and when
they can't find actual healing for their souls, because it is not
to be had, they seek stimulants. `Alas,' laments the soul, _who
can be born gradually into Tao by a prolonged practice
of calm_
A temple service you find interesting is a stimulant for you,
and you could call a sequence of such stimulants `soul-care'. But
_that_ is not the kind of soul-care we want to give you! For that
kind of soul-care will not lead to healing, but only to a
temporary forgetting of your troubles, because the turbulent
magnetic blaze of the sternum is a fact. After you have gone out
of the temple and are left to yourself again, in the midst of


```
THE IMPURITIES OF THE HEART
```
your ordinary interaction with other people, it will not be
long before your state of being reasserts itself, and
restlessness surges through your being with renewed vigour,
setting you on fire with its tongues of flame. Oh, who can
purify into peace the impurities of his heart Anxiety, worry
and fear are your companions, and Lao Tzu projects you right
into the midst of your problems.
So it is not distractions you need, or other people to care
for your soul. What you need is to become your own soul-
guardian. You need to open your soul to the Gnosis. Now you
can try to do this with your will, but that will be forcing
things, which is no use at all. With your will, you can influ-
ence your sternum's magnetic radiation in an artificial way,
momentarily, so that you can send out an artificial vibration
to the Gnosis. However, the Gnosis is not able to respond to
such artificial vibrations, and they always have a dishar-
monious effect. Moreover, the response that does come is
always an imitation, as one soon discovers.
The way to empty your heart of impurities is by no longer
desiring them, without any action of the will. This is only
possible from experience, from the defeat of the soul, so that
one is emptied of natural impulses whilst knowing that there
is only one power that can comfort the soul. Then the rosebud
sends out a call via the sternum, the call of yearning for sal-
vation. And in response, a powerful current of the Gnosis
surges into your being, and by it you are purified into peace,
into stillness. Then the tranquillity of soul for which you
yearn so much will become a reality, and the result will be a
total purification of the blood. All the other life-lights will
then be compelled to follow suit, and with this tranquillity of
soul as a foundation, transfiguration will begin, and the
golden wedding garment will be woven.


```
THE IMPURITIES OF THE HEART
```
In this way, peace descends on the child of man, the peace
that comes from the Gnosis, and he knows the meaning of
the words in Psalm 16, `thou wilt not leave my soul in hell'.
No harm can befall you. This process is the only real
solution to your problems. Because of your experience, and
your yearning for salvation, it will be impossible for your
heart to be full of dialectical impurities or earthly desires.
The current of the Gnosis will touch you, and in this way
you will retain Tao and be born into omnipresence. It will
not leave you, even in hell.
If, out of inner need, you distance yourself from the
nature of death and focus your whole being on the Gnosis,
the purity of your heart will always safeguard itself from
change. You will live in perfect tranquillity of soul, whether
in the temple or outside it, and you will enter the stillness,
the silence, the great calm.
In the times drawing near you will need this state of
being very much indeed if you want to avoid being drawn
into the fierce turmoil of the nature of death. Only with
tranquillity of soul will you be able to navigate the sea of
life and reach your home in the land of the Father.


_When the utmost emptiness has been reached, imperishable
tranquillity is maintained._

_All things are born together; I see them return again._

_All things flower abundantly, then each of them returns to the
source._

_To return to the source is called being at peace. To be at
peace is called returning to true, eternal life._

_To return to life I call being everlasting._

_To know what is everlasting is called being enlightened.
Not to know what is everlasting is called bringing about
one's own misery._

_To know what is everlasting is to have a great soul. Having a
great soul, one is just. Being just, one becomes a king. Being
a king, one is heaven. Being heaven, one is Tao._

_Being Tao, one is everlasting. Even though the body dies,
there are no more perils to he feared._

## 16 The utmost emptiness

The state of utmost emptiness is the condition of the candi-
date who has cleansed his heart of all impurities. In other
words, he has emptied the magnetic system of the sternum of
desires, tensions and conflicts. Such a candidate has become
desireless, empty, and in this condition he can sustain an
unwavering tranquillity of soul. The equilibrium of his soul
can no longer be disturbed. He is safeguarded forever against
change, for he has attained true peace, as one of the charac-
teristics of the people of God.
If the state of utmost emptiness has not yet been reached,
times of soul-tranquillity will always alternate with moments
and periods of soul-conflict, which prove that the magnetic
system of the blood, and hence the heart and the soul-nucleus,
is not yet completely pure. So one of the most important tasks
for a pupil is to trace the inner causes of his soul-conflicts.
These causes are always to be found in his own self. Never,
under any circumstances, can they be caused by another
person, or by something coming from outside oneself.
The fivefold soul-being is an organised whole that receives
whatever is necessary for its maintenance in keeping with its
nature. Whatever is drawn into one's being with the aid of the
magnetic respiratory system is invoked by the being itself. In
many pupils there is still too much of a tendency to want to
`serve two masters'; too much emphasis is placed on earthly
things, which are still too often seen as necessary. There is
still too much desire for things on the horizontal level, and
too much acceptance of things. The result is that one goes on
belonging to two worlds. On the one side there is that


```
THE UTMOST EMPTINESS
```
something of the Gnosis which is active in you, and on the
other side there are earthly things, which are given priority
when they shouldn't be. This only intensifies the conflict with
the Other One. In addition, it perpetuates one's susceptibility
to the restlessness that characterises the whole of ordinary
nature.
However, if you had reached the state of utmost emptiness,
people in the world would of course still be able to attack and
wound your body, but they could not touch your soul. The
whole gamut of soul-conflicts could be going on around you to
lead you astray, but you would no longer be tempted by them.
Your entire soul-state would have entered the peace of the
people of God and all your vital fluids would have become
immune to variability. Your consciousness would perceive and
experience everything, but the equilibrium of your soul could
no longer be disturbed. That is how it ought to begin! Then
any wounds people sought to inflict on you would simply
rebound on them. You would enter the state which has been
known throughout history as `the heroism of the soul'. To be a
hero in that sense does not mean to be courageous or unafraid
of death, but to have entered the new state of being.
Imagine how it would be if someone you loved very much
were to do something terrible to you, and that your soul were
to react against it by entering into conflict. This would be
proof of the existence in your soul of tendencies or causes
that had allowed such a conflict to develop. But if you had
reached the state of utmost emptiness you would, under the
same circumstances, understand what caused the outer
situation so fully that your mind, your will and your heart
would no longer feel any urge to hit back. You would only
observe the situation in the sense of `being on your guard'.
Your purity of heart would protect you absolutely, and your
soul would be free.


THE UTMOST EMPTINESS
The preceding Brotherhoods called those who had reached
this state of utmost emptiness `pure ones', and we hope you
will now realise the full import of that expression. When one
sees it being used, one can be sure one is dealing with trans-
figurists. This purity of the heart, this utmost emptiness, forms
the foundation for the whole process of transfiguration,
because it brings the soul-state into the spheres of that eternal
peace which is of the Gnosis. Once you have entered the
peace of the people of God, once you have been born into it,
nothing can threaten you any longer, and from that moment
onwards, the kingdom of God can be proclaimed within you,
and that means it can be realised within you.
At the moment, the kingdom of God is still being pro-
claimed _to_ you, and you are standing at the gate, but as
long as you do not go in through the gate, your soul-state
will always be prone to variability. It is important to
realise this, and that is why Lao Tzu reminds us that

_All things are born together; I see them return again. All
things flower abundantly, then each of them returns to the
source._

He is reminding us of the way things are in dialectical nature
everything comes and goes, and comes again, in an ever-
recurring cycle of growing, blooming and fading. Dialectical
things come to you from a certain point of departure, and then
they leave you again, to return to that point of departure. The
logical consequence of this fact is that you will not be able to
free yourself of soul-conflicts and soul-turbulence. These, too,
come and go, only to come again, until the soul becomes so
tired of it that it becomes numb, and lapses into indifference,
until the whole thing ends in sickness and death.
The nature of one's soul-conflicts may change in minor ways
with the passing of the years — when one is young,


```
THE UTMOST EMPTINESS
```
one does things in a different way than when one is old —
but in essence, the predicament remains the same. If, with
considerable trouble and pain, you succeed in struggling
through some conflict situation and in driving its causes
back to their source, the only result will be that the source
will immediately start sending those same causes back to
you again. That is the signature of the nature of death, and
of everything that lives and moves within it. The ordinary
human being can never free himself of it; his being is not
safeguarded against variability and change. That is why
he needs to return to his own source, which is the
Adamitic state. And it is not some part of him that must
return, but his whole self. His entire microcosm must
return to the Immovable Kingdom, the source of the
beginning. Only when you return to that source will your
soul be at peace, and only then will you rise above the
interplay of changes. Your soul will transfigure; the new
soul will be born. Soul-transfiguration is the first
necessity, because life proceeds from the soul. That is
why the Bible is so full of references to the salvation of
the soul, and that is why Lao Tzu says

_To return to the source is called being at peace. To be at peace
is called returning to true, eternal life._

_To return to life I call being everlasting._

_To know what is everlasting is called being enlightened. Not to
know what is everlasting is called bringing about one's own
misery._

No one can really understand what is revealed to him from the
Universal Doctrine unless the Gnosis has touched him. If you
have approached the School of the Rosycross out of a genuine
inner need, longing for the Gnosis with all your heart, you


```
THE UTMOST EMPTINESS
```
will have been moved by the current of the gnostic plenitude,
which will have been drawn into your system via the magnetic
respiration of the sternum. Such a touch enlightens one's
understanding. An enlightened person is someone who lives in
the touch of the Gnosis. He _knows,_ because the nature of life
imparts not only power, but also wisdom. As long as you have
not been enlightened by the divine nature, you will go on
bringing about your own misery.
That may sound harsh, but the truth of it is undeniable. Day
and night, you will be forging a continuous chain of causes
and effects amid the interplay of change. Hence the conclu-
sion, a conclusion that reverberates like a Song of Songs, a cry
of triumph _To know what is everlasting is to have a great
soul —_ a new soul. The new, enlightened understanding is
always proof of soul rebirth.

_Having a great soul, one is just,_ not according to the law of this
nature, which is subject to change, but according to the eternal,
immutable, fundamental law. Thus, the transfiguration of the
soul must be followed by a total, structural rebirth.

In this way, by _being just, one becomes a king._ One becomes a
priest-king of the original realm; one enters the Mystery
School.

Then, _being a king, one is heaven,_ and the all, the totality of the
divine nature, is realised, so that _being heaven, one is Tao_ —
one becomes one with IT.

And _being Tao, one is everlasting —_ one enters eternity. _Even
though the body dies, there are no more perils to be feared._ The
body is a phenomenon of the old life, to be laid aside when the
right time comes.


```
THE UTMOST EMPTINESS
```
This imperishable, incomparable salvation is made possible
by the rebirth of the soul. That rebirth is the key to your
eternal happiness.

## 17 The people and their princes

When one looks at the seventeenth chapter of the Tao Te
Ching, one immediately realises that when it uses the word
`princes', it means the spiritual leaders of humanity, at
various levels of development. In ancient times, rulers
were also religious leaders, or better still, spiritual leaders
were also state rulers. A symbolic relic of that can be seen,
for instance, in the English royal family, in which the
monarch is also the head of the Church of England.
At the beginning of a new human epoch, a new day of
manifestation, the remnant of fallen humanity is brought back
into manifestation. The emptied, purified microcosms are
brought out of the cosmic night into a new period of dialectical
activity, in which they are again given the opportunity to
surround a personality. When such a day of manifestation
dawns, spiritual leaders are sent to humankind, whose task is
to guide and impel it towards liberation. In these early stages,
obviously, it is not possible for such leaders to be drawn from
among the human beings manifesting on earth, because they
are not yet sufficiently mature.
So in this tender stage of human development, members of
the last and lowest link in the chain of preceding Brother-
hoods emerged from the chain of immortal souls as princes
and leaders. Having already attained liberation before the last
cosmic night fell, there was a vast distance between these
sublime princes and leaders and the young remnant of fallen
humanity. Owing to this immense distance, direct contact
with them was impossible, and the most that could be
achieved was an impersonal link through which humanity's


```
THE PEOPLE AND THEIR PRINCES
```
sensory perception and dream-life could be influenced. At that
stage, human entities were incapable of perceiving their spiritual
leaders in person. Nevertheless, all were convinced of their
presence because they experienced it inwardly. They
experienced the gods. That is why the Tao Te Ching says _In
ancient times the only thing the people knew about their
princes was that they existed._
The second hierarchy of princes was drawn partly from the
people itself, under very special conditions, for in the mean-
time, the racial body of young humankind had developed.
Certain predisposed entities could now be overshadowed by
the gods of the last link in the chain. Later, some gods were
able to manifest themselves in a microcosm in an even more
direct way, initially by supplanting a person's consciousness
while he was in a temple, and subsequently by birth. In this
way, a more direct and personal link between the spiritual
princes and humankind became possible. This direct, personal
connection was also necessary because man's inner vision was
becoming increasingly dimmed as a result of his immersion in
matter. This explains why the Tao Te Ching says _then came
princes who were loved and praised by the people._ The
worship of the first phase was supplemented with the love and
praise inspired by actually beholding the princes in person.
As the development of dialectical humanity progressed
further, a third phase became necessary. The spiritual princes
belonging to the last link in the chain could now withdraw
because they had completed the work of laying down the path
of magic and giving all the necessary teachings and instruc-
tions. At the same time, the human racial body and microcos-
mic state had matured sufficiently for a hierarchy of spiritual
leaders to be recruited from among humankind itself for the
first time in the history of the new humanity. Through this
new human priesthood, at certain appropriate times, one of


```
THE PEOPLE AND THEIR PRINCES
```
the former spiritual princes would return to earth to sound the
reveille and ensure that the proper contact was maintained for as
long as possible.
This was extremely necessary, because the developing
human I-centrality soon had a deteriorating effect. The new
hierarchy of priestly princes, recruited from among human-
kind itself, disintegrated because of quarrels about power, and
because of envy, jealousy and the whole range of human
passions. And since this hierarchy had been trained in magic,
and the racial body was still rather tenuous and not as dense
as it is now, it was possible for magic practices to have far-
reaching effects. Some displeased ruler's magical incantations
could cause immediate death. Good and evil in their extreme
forms were considerably intermingled, and thus the people
had every reason to fear their princes. Hence the words _Then
came those who were feared by them._
Lao Tzu scans the whole of human history extremely
swiftly, because he is concerned not with the past, but with
the present. Hence the brevity of the sentence he uses to
describe the next phase in man's development. The time
when rulers were also priests passed by, and spiritual stan-
dards continued to plummet. This was inevitable, because
the densification of the racial body and the deterioration of
the ruling priesthood naturally led to the breaking of the
connection with the princes belonging to the last link in the
chain. Seen from the spiritual point of view, there remained
only the presence of the gnostic radiation-field and the
Spiritual Schools, which took over the tasks of the decadent
priesthood. These Spiritual Schools had to operate with the
utmost caution because they were fiercely persecuted in all
kinds of ways. That is why the next phase could only lead,
firstly, to a degeneration of the priesthood into black magic
practices, and secondly, to the development of theology, as


```
THE PEOPLE AND THEIR PRINCES
```
purely intellectual knowledge without any inner, priestly
standing, rights or qualities.
In this way contempt came to the man of the masses, an
ever-growing scorn. Love and adoration vanished, and so did
fear. Priests and theologians were no longer taken seriously.
Hence the words _Those who came thereafter were held in
contempt by them._

The period we live in now is one in which the majority of
human beings have completely lost any connection with the
Gnosis. As humanity continued to crystallise and degenerate,
such connections were betrayed and destroyed. The masses
were hemmed in and indoctrinated by a sham spiritual life,
which most people nowadays scorn and distrust completely.
In theological circles there is a certain amount of self-
knowledge, and people are aware of achieving nothing and
being ignorant, but even in their ignorance many theologians
believe themselves to have been called to spiritual
leadership. In addition, so much blood has been shed by their
forefathers over the centuries, so much evil and cruelty
perpetrated that, laden with this heritage as their foundation,
like a mark engraved in their blood, they remain bound. Just
think of the witch trials of a few hundred years ago; of the
countless persecutions of the servants of Spiritual Schools
like the Brotherhood of the Cathars. Think of Calvin, who
instigated the persecution of Michel Servet. Millions have
been massacred in our era, and this has resulted in an
increasingly powerful blood-reaction of mass distrust and
hatred. And you know the law _The person who does not
trust others, will not receive the trust of others._
Of course, efforts are being made to develop the ecumenical
movement, to form a kind of new `spiritual international', but
how can anything new in the sense of a restored link with


```
THE PEOPLE AND THEIR PRINCES
```
the Gnosis be realised on the basis of ignorance, combined
with such a damaged condition and such a vast hereditary
burden The present-day priesthoods have long since lost
their rights as first-born. Those rights were transferred to the
Spiritual Schools many thousands of years ago, and they have
had an ecumenical movement ever since that time. The theo-
logical ecumenical movement, on the other hand, only con-
sists of a succession of congresses and strident publications,
whereas it is clear that quite a different path ought to be fol-
lowed. In this connection just look at the closing verses of
chapter 17

_The ancients were slow and ponderous in their speech. When
they had accomplished their tasks and their labours had borne
fruit, the people said `We live spontaneously.'_

Genuine workers in the vineyard of the light are slow and
ponderous in their speech. This means that they only speak
when it is really necessary, and never merely for effect. Their
attention is focused on accomplishing their tasks and seeing
that their labours bear fruit, so they do not suffer from verbal
delirium, and see no point in saying anything merely for the
sake of appearances, or to indulge in conjecture. For every
worker and every pupil needs to demonstrate the facts in
every aspect of their lives, both inner and outer. Only facts
can really speak and testify. Only truth, only reality, is libe-
rating. Only through the rebirth of the soul can one transcend
the world of time and space.
After a great deal of effort, a working apparatus and a basic
foundation of inner values have been realised. The ancient
wisdom has been divested of its material veils, the connection
with the princes of the last link in the chain has been restored,
and the sevenfold Living Body has been made ready. So now
we stand before the task of gathering in the harvest from all


```
THE PEOPLE AND THEIR PRINCES
```
the corners of the world. The forge has been built, the anvil
is in position, the fire has been lit and is being roused to a
fierce blaze. So now the hammer-blows must fall. A new
priestly host must now prove itself.
Each member of it must personally demonstrate a new
state of being, not with words, but with facts. That is the
key which can break open humankind's present blood-state.
People are drowning in distrust and contempt, born of a
nameless woe. Do not come to them only with words; you
will never succeed. Do not come to them with the ordinary
methods, with pious, honeyed words, but go to them in your
new soul-state.
And when, in this way, your tasks have been
accomplished and your labours have borne fruit, the
people who are ennobled to it will say _We live
spontaneously._ We are coming to you, we are with you,
spontaneously, because we see the facts. We are coming
because we cannot help it; we are inwardly moved to do
so.' Then they will practise not-doing just as you do, and
they will attain what you have attained. And that is the
path in practice, in the living present; that is the
prescription for liberation. It is the prescription of the
ancients.

# When Tao was neglected,

# humanism and justice appeared

If one has some knowledge of the Universal Doctrine, the
reason for the confusion and degeneracy of humankind is
certainly no mystery. When a new human epoch begins at the
dawn of a new day of manifestation and all microcosms
receive a wealth of new possibilities for resurrection, the
opportunity for liberation is open to all. But that opportunity
does not stay open indefinitely. Such a thing is simply im-
possible in a dialectical dispensation. That is why every day
of manifestation follows a set pattern, beginning with a
period of birth and growth, followed by a period of maturity,
and ending with a period of dissolution and death. As this
pattern unfolds, the racial body becomes increasingly dense,
and a state of maximum separation is reached. As we ex-
plained in the last chapter, the Gnosis — Tao — comes to
young humankind at the dawn of a cosmic day and remains
with it for as long as possible, in an attempt to liberate as
many microcosms as possible, as quickly as possible. And the
harvest is indeed great, but for those who remain behind, the
tragic moment of parting occurs. That moment now lies
behind us and our fellow human beings. We belong to the
residue, to those who, until now, did not want to follow the
path of liberation.
At the time of that separation, one last remedy was en-
trusted to the Spiritual Schools of the sevenfold World
Brotherhood. We prefer not to say any more about the
tragic decline of the hierarchical priesthoods. But even with
the greatest optimism, it could not be said that any more
than a very small percentage of humankind was ready to


```
WHEN TAO WAS NEGLECTED...
```
receive this help offered by the Spiritual Schools, because
only a few were capable of showing even a glimmer of
reaction to the magnetic radiations of the Gnosis. For the
rest, after a period of `neglecting Tao', came a total, funda-
mental rupture with Tao.
It would be understating the truth, though, if we were not
to say that in the great majority of human beings there are
still elements present that clearly show they are called to a
better fate and a higher good. A neglected true-bred dog may
look terrible, but you can still see its pedigree, its ancestry,
and the same applies to humankind. The rose of the heart
speaks within the human being, and its presence is evident,
even though one may give expression to it only in a very
negative and caricatural way. Humankind shows its
`pedigree', its royal descent.
But the tragedy of it all is shown clearly in an image
Johann Valentin Andreae uses in his _Alchemical Wedding of
Christian Rosycross._ He shows humanity imprisoned in a
dark dungeon, in which everyone is busy blaming everyone
else for the darkness, their misery and their shackles. People
quarrel and fight, but at the same time they are doing their
best to restore order and improve things, both in theory and
in practice. They do not succeed. Their efforts are
ineffective, but at the same time very understandable. That is
why Lao Tzu says, _when Tao was neglected, humanism and
justice appeared._
Did you know that the history of humanism as we know it
today goes back four hundred years In 1953 a congress on
humanism was held in Geneva, in memory of the fact that
there, four hundred years ago, Michel Servet was burnt at the
stake at the instigation of Calvin. At the time, this led to a
tremendous humanistic protest instigated by Castellio, and
ever since then humanism has grown and set its mark on our


```
WHEN TAO WAS NEGLECTED...
```
civilisation. Humanists give their utmost for their cause, and
indeed, where would we be without humanism and human
justice
But if one considers humanity's hellish decline in the light of
all these efforts, the extent of it becomes even more evi-
dent. We have had four hundred years of humanism, but we
have also had four hundred years of suffering and misery — the
most terrible wars and destruction, a frenzy of murder
and slaughter, with a tiny sprinkling of humanism and justice
to sweeten the brew of blood and tears. It seems that the human
being has a dual nature. Potentially, he is a god, yet
at the same time he is a devil. So the tangled, writhing tumult
of human life in the dungeon goes on. What an awful
predicament!
So is there any point in humanism Should we stop being
humanistic Well, if the urge to love humanity is present
within you, you can't — and you shouldn't — switch it off, but
you should realise that the ordinary, humanistic methods of
expressing that love will never be able to provide a final
solution to human suffering.
What about justice, then Shouldn't we strive for what is
right But what _is_ right for the writhing, tangled mass of
humanity in this dark dungeon What is good for one can be
vastly different from what is good for another and, all too often,
those who campaign for some social improvement or
other have their own vested interests at heart. Surely you have
noticed how easy it is for people to become hypocrites in the
name of justice That is why Lao Tzu says, _when acumen and
shrewdness appeared, great hypocrisy developed._

You have interests on the horizontal level; you have your
duties and your obligations, your concerns and your need
to support yourself. As a result, you are bound to have


```
WHEN TAO WAS NEGLECTED...
```
developed a certain measure of acumen and discernment. You
use carefully planned tactics to achieve your aims, and one of
those tactics will be to try to get justice on your side. But then
it will not be for the sake of justice itself, but only to protect
your own personal interests. And that is hypocrisy. All kinds
of confusions arise, and situations become more and more
complex. If one sees humankind's political struggles in the
light of the Tao Te Ching, one is bound to feel revolted by
them. In politics and economics people lie and deceive
intentionally, and in the dungeon of our society, all we can do
is watch while our leaders continue with their mutual back-
stabbing and back-biting. It can hardly be said that the great
human family lives in harmony; far from it. It is a terrible
situation.

But even in the face of all this, humankind does not deny its
high origin. The great human family is not in harmony. You
know that. You experience that. But still, _when the family no
longer lived in harmony, parental and filial love came into
being._ Like little islands in a raging sea, there are thousands of
families in which all is peace and contentment. There are
plenty of exceptions to this, of course, but even then, parental
and filial love still exist. Is that kind of love wrong, then Not
at all! Let the peace of your family life and the love between
parents and children be a comfort to you. It is perhaps your
only point of rest amid the storm of life.
But do not overestimate the quality of all this, for does your
heart beat equally lovingly for the family of your neighbour
Our homes are piled on top of each other and next to each other
like bird-cages. In many cages there is a great deal of
harmonious chirping. Nevertheless, all the inhabitants are party
to the conflict in the dungeon. Sometimes, community leaders
hold up the nobility of family life as the cork on which


```
WHEN TAO WAS NEGLECTED...
```
our society floats. They are right, for it is a life jacket that saves
us from drowning. But do not idealise it, for it is only a sad
remnant, a faint glimmer of the original life with Tao.
As with the family, so it is with nations. Each nation is a
family on a larger scale. There are lots of nations on earth,
into which the original `family' of humankind has been frag-
mented. There are all kinds of goings on in these families, and
sometimes they fight with each other. But even so, in the lives
of all those nation-families something of divine nature still
survives — feelings of patriotism, for instance. Whether or
not you, personally, have these feelings, and how you
experience them, does not affect the point we are trying to
make. We are only trying to show that such feelings are alive
in every nation. No person on earth is totally unaffected by the
psyche of the nation to which he belongs, because such effects
are rooted in the blood. And we know to what results patriotic
feelings can lead, even though they can be thought of as good
qualities, as sparks of the original life.
So we can easily understand Lao Tzu when he says _When
the provinces of the kingdom were in confusion, faithful subjects
appeared._ There is no need for us to illustrate this point. You
can refer to your own experiences, and when you search your
own heart, in the light of what is expected of you as a pupil of
the Spiritual School, you will have to admit that there is a great
deal left for you to do before you can say you have freed
yourself from delusion.
For surely it is delusion to content yourself with caricatural
reflections of the light Surely it would be much better to seek
the light itself What you need, surely, is to return to Tao, while
you still have the chance. You have heard the calling voice of
the Spiritual School, and you have heard about what will serve
your eternal peace. As you have responded to that call, what
matters now is what you do about it!


WHEN TAO WAS NEGLECTED...
It is staggering to think that the Tao Te Ching was brought
to humanity at least six hundred years before Christ. And in
our opinion, it is several thousand years older than that. In a
way, then, we can hardly call ourselves pioneers. We are
more like laggards! So, laggards that we are, let us go
forward while there is still time. Let us leave the dungeon and
enter into freedom, through soul-rebirth

_Being Tao, one is everlasting. Even though the body dies, there
are no more perils to be feared._


_Put away wisdom and abandon knowledge, then the people will
be a hundred times happier._

_Put away philanthropy and abandon justice, then the people will
return to being loving parents and children._

_Put away subterfuge and abandon acquisitiveness, then there
will be no more thieves and robbers._

_Renounce these things and never be content with outward
appearances._

_Instead, I will show you what you need to do. See yourself in
your original simplicity and maintain your original purity. Have
little egoism and few desires._

```
Tao Te Ching chapter 19
```

## 19— I Abandon knowledge

```
With its few remaining shreds of the original life, humanity is
lost in the dark dungeon of the nature of death, trying to make
the best of things with philanthropy, justice, familial love and
patriotism. Although these methods are ineffective in terms of
the ultimate results, and can therefore never lead to a real
solution, they must nevertheless be regarded as the only way
for humanity to express its potential for goodness.
Tao was neglected — and we have looked at the various
consequences, some of which you will have experienced for
yourself. Our findings brought us to the conclusion that there is
only one solution to use the cords being let down for your sake
into the pit of death, and, with their help, to follow the path of
return. This path begins with the rebirth of the soul, which
straight away admits the soul into a state of peace.
This path of return has various aspects, all of which you need
to take into account. We have often mentioned the fivefold
universal Gnosis, a process which corresponds with your vital
fluids

insight, which involves the blood;
yearning for salvation, which involves the hormonal
fluids;
self-surrender, which involves the serpent-fire;
the new way of life, which involves the nerve-fluid;
the actual rebirth of the soul, which involves the astral
fluid.
For many years, every effort has been made to give pupils of
the School of the Rosycross sufficient insight into their con-
dition. The same can be said about yearning for salvation.
```

```
ABANDON KNOWLEDGE
```
When a person has some insight, he begins to yearn for the new
life-field. For years we have been telling you almost daily that
the self-surrender of the I, the I-less state, is the key to the new
life-field. And you know that these three paths — insight,
yearning for salvation and self-surrender — are connected with
electromagnetic radiations which are present and can be
experienced in the powerfield of the School.
After a number of years, a new electromagnetic force emerged
in our powerfield, which caused us to speak about group unity
and the new way of life. This is a force that works primarily on
your heart, a force that awakens you to action, to outward proof
of the pure state of your pupilship. This force generated an
avalanche of changes and developments in our School, changes
which, on the one hand, filled us with gratitude and joy, but on
the other hand also brought sorrow, because the knife of
purification and liberation had to be used with such relentless
courage. One of our Temple Songs puts it this way

```
New attitude to life requires
wise and clear reflecting.
Those who depart for the new life
make a new beginning.
Day by day, come what may,
always I-denying;
with the group uniting.
```
We made the preparations for the new beginning, and those
who still cherished the I and its delusions and therefore stood in
the way of the journey excluded themselves from the group.
For now, though, let us assume that you have started out on
that journey by accepting the new approach to life; that you are
willing to accept the consequences of making that


```
ABANDON KNOWLEDGE
```
journey. Even then, there will still be various problems that
arise, and they will have to be solved, for if we cannot
solve our problems, our normal cheerfulness will give way
to melancholy and fanaticism. What we mean is that,
besides the broad directives regarding the path, which you
know and accept, and besides a basic way of life in keeping
with those directives, there are practical, day-to-day aspects
of one's approach to life that have to be considered.
When you focus your attention on the aim of the School, you
know what is expected of you. But during your everyday life
you also have to contend with ordinary situations, with all their
ups and downs, and you are often at your wits' end. In this way
you make mistakes, and they often affect your fate in quite an
undesirable way. That is why, in everyday situations, too, a
pupil needs to adopt a carefully chosen approach to life. You
may not take the attitude that `Ordinary life does not interest
me. I have nothing to do with it. I am finished with it.'
It would be foolish to talk like that, because the fact that
you are here in this earthly existence proves that life has not
yet finished with you. That is why, whatever your circum-
stances, you should also choose what behaviour patterns you
will follow when faced with situations on the horizontal
plane. Lao Tzu tells you how to do that.

So, firstly, in ordinary life, you need to put away wisdom and
abandon knowledge. You only need to radiate your soul-light.
This means that if you approach your fellow human beings
bursting with all the gnostic knowledge and wisdom you have
acquired, they will find you insufferable. You will awaken
feelings of hatred. You will arouse opposition. You will start a
war. But you will do wonders with a little knowledge of human
nature, a bit of understanding and some love, supported by the
new light of the soul. In this way, you will make the


```
ABANDON KNOWLEDGE
```
people around you happy. In such an atmosphere of harmony
and happiness people will be more open than ever to your
spiritual approach to life.
That is why Lao Tzu says _Put away wisdom and abandon
knowledge._ Behave as naturally as possible. _Then the people
will be a hundred times happier._ Then you will be following
the path of least resistance, and that is exactly what will enable
you to dissolve all resistance.
This approach is also important when one is confronted with
all the turmoil created by the human struggle to achieve justice
and humanitarian values. There are countless movements trying
to help humanity on the dialectical level by campaigning for
certain legislations or providing humanitarian aid. Think of the
many religious, humanitarian and political movements. The
world is rife with their debates and publications. They have
their publicity methods and their organisations. They call and
beckon you from every point of the compass, all with their own
points of view, and all with the good intention of transforming
the chaos of the dungeon into order, and if possible, divine
order.
Do not belittle these people. And do not attack them, either.
Do not try to impose your point of view on them. View their
efforts with great respect, for they are doing what they can. Only,
do not join in the controversy. Do not allow yourself to be drawn
into it. And whilst you should not expect anything lasting from
such efforts, you should remain ready to respond to the needs of
the moment. If there is any group that can have an influence on
the world situation it is a gnostic group, because of its radiation-
field. If the Spiritual School frees itself as a group from this
tremendous worldwide turmoil, then it will make a significant
contribution towards the ultimate restoration of the unity of the
great human family. Then humanitarian efforts on the horizontal
level will be replaced


```
ABANDON KNOWLEDGE
```
by reality. Then we will hasten the coming of the period
known as the millennium.
This process must be carried out by the Spiritual Schools of
the sevenfold World Brotherhood. That is why Lao Tzu said

_Put away philanthropy and abandon justice, then the people
will return to love._

This development is only just beginning, but if you are wil-
ling to participate, you will discover how important all this
will become. We have been talking about the social para-
graph, which concerns the pupil's relationship to society,
and we have discussed his relationship to his fellow human
beings. But this paragraph has more aspects we need to
consider.

_Put away subterfuge and abandon acquisitiveness, and there
will be no more thieves and robbers._

What does this sentence mean Let us apply it first to the
School, and second to your own individual state. Suppose
your motives in the School were impure in any way. This
impurity would obviously stem from the fundamental im-
purities of your heart. Then you are carried along by the
flames of your desires. With the techniques of subterfuge,
which you have learned during the course of your life, you
try to achieve your aims. You try to gain something that, in
fact, is not meant for you. You try to force something that
would eventually come anyway when the time was right.
So you act like a thief or a robber, and obviously this will
invoke all kinds of forces and vibrations that are in
keeping with your actions. In this way the School is
hindered and its field of work disturbed. In such a situation
an unholy radiation would emanate from the School that
would be destructive rather than redeeming in its effects.
So in a


```
ABANDON KNOWLEDGE
```
Spiritual School, especially, you should set aside all that
desire, subterfuge and acquisitiveness.
Try to apply this point of view in your everyday life as
well, consciously and consistently. Dare to do that! Then
your development on the path towards peace of the soul will
be influenced very much to the good. Haven't you
summoned rather a lot of thieves and robbers in your own
respiration-field And what a lot of difficulties this has
created in the lives of others! It does not help you and it
destroys others. So _Put away subterfuge and abandon
acquisitiveness, and there will be no more thieves and
robbers._ Put this approach to life into practice.


# 19 - II

## 19 — II Renounce these things

```
There is one more part of Chapter 19 of the Tao Te Ching we
would like to consider
```
```
Renounce these things and never be content with outward
appearances.
```
```
Instead, I will show you what you need to do. See yourself in
your original simplicity and maintain your original purity.
Have little egoism and few desires.
```
```
Renounce these things. What things Let us remind ourselves. In
your everyday approach to life, as far as your contacts with other
people are concerned, put away your wisdom and your
knowledge. The wisdom and knowledge you have received are
for your own, personal use, to help you in the process of
developing from a mortal soul into a reborn soul. And one of the
results of that process is soul-radiation. This soul-radiation
emanates from you independently of your will, without you
thinking about it, and it can never be wounding, antagonising or
disagreeable to anybody. Your own wisdom and knowledge,
however useful to you personally, can only be useful to others on
the path if they specifically ask for it; if, in their soul's need, they
ask you for that sustenance. The rest of the time, just approach
others with love and understanding, patience and compassion,
remembering your common humanity. In this way you will be
able to bring happiness to all the living beings you meet.
The second thing you must renounce has to do with philan-
```

```
RENOUNCE THESE THINGS
```
thropy and justice. There is a seething turmoil of countless
movements, great and small, religious, humanitarian, political,
occult and economic, all imploring your attention, your
cooperation, your vote, your devotion. But you do not allow
yourself to be drawn into these things, because you see the
fruitlessness of it all, and you know that by joining in, you
would only succeed in perpetuating the conflict. But neither do
you react to these things with animosity, or in an unintelligent
or arrogant way. You remain silent, and bring the offering of
your soul-light.
The third thing you need to renounce is your cunning and
acquisitiveness, for these characteristics are weapons used to
rob what you are not entitled to and to steal what is not
rightfully yours. You would then draw around yourself an
atmosphere of disharmony, robbery and destruction.
We explained this threefold renunciation in the last chapter.
But if you decide to do it, remember that you must not do it in
appearance only. If you know that something is not good and
you give it up outwardly but not inwardly, then it will only be
a sham. Then you will just be following a law that has been
imposed on you, or that you are imposing on yourself. You
will be living under the law, in the old testamental phase. You
will be submitting to the law, but there will be no new reality
in your blood. Then you will not have put away ordinary
justice, and you will be contenting yourself with outward
appearances. The new approach to life only has value if you
practise it from within, motivated by an urge which arises
from the heart and is seated in the blood. If it does not, then it
is only a sham, a pretence. Then you will be judged, just as it
is said in chapter 18 _When acumen and shrewdness appeared,
great hypocrisy developed._
You need to realise that merely keeping up outer ap-
pearances will not take you one step further in the Spiritual


```
RENOUNCE THESE THINGS
```
School; it will not bring you any closer to success. That is
an important thing to remember, because in the ordinary
world outer appearances do carry weight. And that causes
trouble, because pretence engenders self-preservation, and
self-preservation engenders war. The habit of pretence, of
doing things just for the sake of appearances, is so
ingrained in the blood, generation after generation, that
there is a tendency to continue with it in the Spiritual
School, in the process of following the path. But then you
don't call it pretence, or hypocrisy, for those are ugly words.
You say, 'I want to do it, I'm doing my best to do it, and I
yearn for it so much,' and things like that.
We are not saying this because we want to insult you or
put you in an unfavourable light, but because it is our duty to
ask you, `Is the Gnosis a simulated value for you at this
moment Is it a value that is as yet outside you, but which
you would very much like to possess' If so, you can study
the characteristics and purposes of that value and you can try
to approximate and imitate it with the dialectical means you
have at your disposal. But then you will be simulating
pupilship, and that is something which is indeed done,
sometimes in a very subtle way. But if pupilship is
simulated, there is no blood-property. You need to
_demonstrate_ renewal, in and through your own blood-field.
That is why Lao Tzu says in chapter 19 _Instead, I will show
you what you need to do._

De Genestet, a Dutch poet, once said

```
From pretence, 0 Lord, deliver me;
nature and truth return to me.
```
_See yourself in your original simplicity and maintain your
original purity._ What does this mean Certainly not the origi-


```
RENOUNCE THESE THINGS
```
nal, divine simplicity and purity. You cannot see that simpli-
city and purity in yourself because you, as a mortal soul, have
never known that state. But if you approach the Spiritual
School and are determined to walk the path, then you will
need to free yourself from all the veils that pretence, imitation
and education have formed around you and stand on the foun-
dation of your true nature and state of being.
Every human being has a particular type, a particular char-
acter, with a certain key-note. If you understand this with
self-knowledge, neither overrating nor underrating yourself,
you will be standing in your original simplicity. Then you
will know your own type. It is with the purity of that know-
ledge that you need to approach the Gnosis, and then the
process of insight, yearning for salvation, self-surrender and
the new way of life will be able to unfold very quickly! That
is what you need to do. If you do not, then you will always
run the risk of approaching the Gnosis with pretence, with all
its consequences. See yourself, from day to day, in your
absolute simplicity and on that foundation, follow the process
with purity. That is what Lao Tzu means.
As long as you have to live in this world, you will have
material interests and needs to take care of, and you will need
to look after yourself. So the thing to do is to reduce your
personal needs and material obligations to the simplest and
smallest proportions. So have little selfishness and few
desires, and let what little you do need be only for the fulfil-
ment of your biological needs. Put aside pretence and begin
your path as a pupil in simplicity and purity. Then group-unity
— the great community of the soul — will break through
powerfully, and in a glorious way. Leave behind everything
that serves no purpose or hinders you. Or, to put it in the
words of our Temple Song number 88


```
RENOUNCE THESE THINGS
Cast, then, away
your burdens grey,
tainting your blood with their
decay, and enter freedom without
delay.
```
So, having immersed you yet again in the wisdom of the
Tao Te Ching, we hope that the fruits of all these reflections
will be seen in your way of life.


_Abandon study, and your worries will cease._

_What is the use of linguistic subtleties Much better is know-
ledge of the distinction between good and evil._

_Alas, the world has become a wilderness without end._

_The multitude rejoice and are glad, like those who enjoy their
food, like people who have climbed a high terrace in spring._

_I alone am calm and have not yet moved. I am like a new-born
babe who has not yet smiled. I am free and without limitation, as
if there were no place to which I would like to return._

_The multitude have enough and to spare; I alone am like one
who has lost everything. I have the heart of a fool; I am a chaos
of confusion._

_The common people possess sparkling lucidity; I alone am dark.
The common people possess penetrative insight; I alone am
mournfully anxious. I am indeterminate, like the sea; I am
restless, tossed to and fro by the waves._

_Everyone has a reason for everything; I alone am foolish._

_I alone am different from the common people, because I revere
the Mother who nourishes all things._

Tao Te Ching chapter 20

# 20 - i

# Abandon study

Let us try to understand the gnostic meaning of chapter 20 of
the Tao Te Ching. Did you feel confused when you read the
words _Abandon study and your worries will cease_
People who depend on intellectualism are likely to find
these words either foolish or hurtful. And aren't they in con-
flict with the standpoint of the School of the Rosycross
Don't we say that one needs to possess knowledge in order to
understand the Gnosis Doesn't the Bible say, 'My people are
lost for lack of knowledge' Isn't it very important to study
the contents of our literature if one wants to understand the
aims of the Gnosis Perhaps you will say, `Surely, pupils of
all times have always received instruction, either through the
spoken or written word, or through the language of the mys-
teries Should one give all that up, then How is it possible
to use such ridiculous words, dating from 600 years before
Christ, as if they were gnostic wisdom' So let us examine
what Lao Tzu may really have meant. Let us start by taking a
familiar example
Suppose you had read all the literature of our School.
Suppose that your interpretation of it was based on every-
thing you had read in related literature over the years. And
imagine that you had a good memory and had remembered
clearly everything you had read, to such an extent that
people could say about you, `He knows it! She knows it!'
Would that knowledge have brought you one millimetre
closer to a genuine possession Is there not an enormous dif-
ference between intellectual knowledge and real possession
Are there not many people who, in their enormous craving for


```
ABANDON STUDY
```
Life, throw themselves on the literature of the School and gulp
it down as fast as they can And afterwards, have you ever
observed or heard about their reactions One chapter brought
joy, the second sorrow, the third repugnance, and the next,
perhaps, deep confusion, followed by a spark of hope, and then
a sense of fear, and so on.
The whole gamut of psychological reactions is gone
through in quick succession, and the result is one great
tangle. Often the person concerned experienced so much
tension and underwent such a total astral collapse, with all
kinds of worries and anxieties gathering together like clouds,
that the opposite was achieved to what, in his hunger, the
person had expected.
If you have ever observed such a psychological and emo-
tional breakdown and understood its cause, then surely Lao
Tzu's words, `For goodness' sake, give up all that studying,'
will grip you straight from the heart
Besides psychological and moral difficulties, too much
intellectual analysis can also cause other problems. The
absorbtion of theoretical information on a purely intellectual
level produces a tendency to overrate oneself, and to think, `I
know all that.' In such a psychological state one can crystallise,
and when one tries to put these intellectual theories into
practice, one can do harm to others, as well. In any case, it
always means that real human development is prevented.
The immense pressure we experience today towards the
development of the intellect stems from the conditions
humankind has created for itself. Mechanisation, industri-
alisation, and the extremely complex structure of human
society make study necessary for almost everyone.
But has it really made people any happier, better or wiser
Perhaps you have studied a lot in your life, or maybe you are
studying still, but has it freed you from your worries And


```
ABANDON STUDY
```
what about the people who devise all those theories, and the
people who teach them to others Has their learning freed them
from their cares They know a great deal and because of that
people think they possess spiritual abilities. But what a
mistake! What a devaluation of the real purpose of life!
This situation has gone so far now that if, at this moment,
people were to change course and take the advice to `abandon
study' as a general directive, the most almighty clamour would
break out `Surely we cannot let our children enter life in
society without studying how it works, and without the training
they need to look after themselves'
So can all this really be called progress and development Is
it not true that nearly everyone is caught up in it Almost
everyone is following a road that, according to Lao Tzu, leads
to perdition. That is why Lao Tzu observes in Chapter 20 _Alas,
the world has become a wilderness without end._
A cultured person, by today's standards, is in many res-
pects a marked man. In most cases, the grip of the nature of
death has bound such people in powerful chains. So what is
Lao Tzu's solution to this enormous problem, which he
showed his pupils as long ago as six hundred years before
Christ Well, it is not a solution that, once arrived at, brings
with it new worries. It is one that, if you work at it consis-
tently and honestly, will lead you to liberation.
Could that be true Could that really be possible Let us
think about it and see.



# 20 - 11

## 20— II The world has become a wilderness

```
Have you ever honestly examined your life and yourself, and
realised that you are caught in a chain of cause and effect
And that your children are stuck in the same straitjacket Lao
Tzu drew attention to this predicament two and a half thou-
sand years ago, and since then it has become many times
worse. So if you really want to experience pupilship of a
gnostic Spiritual School, if you really want to ascend the path
of liberation, you must `abandon study'.
To understand this injunction and be able to explain it the
way it was meant, one must begin by drawing a distinction
between worldly knowledge and real wisdom. Worldly
knowledge aims to fit the human being for his role in life
and to prepare him for his passage through the nature of
death. Study is also meant to ease one's course through life,
and to provide access to life's various comforts. It plays on
earthly drives such as the desire for honour, fame, power
and possessions and also on people's lower instincts.
In practice, however, it turns out that much of this supposed
knowledge is founded on the most shaky grounds. In fact it has
no real foundation at all, and belongs to the realms of pure
conjecture. That is why applying such knowledge can only add
to the problems afflicting humankind.
If you look at the course of your own life, you will probably
realise that you have often been the victim of knowledge that,
when applied, turned out not to have been knowledge at all but
largely just a sophisticated form of supposition.
To give you an example vegetarians, who depend on the
products of the vegetable kingdom, have experienced how
```

```
THE WORLD HAS BECOME A WILDERNESS
```
the whole of the vegetable kingdom is being poisoned, via
the atmosphere and the soil, by the products of modern
agricultural science. Indeed, the entire biosphere and all the
creatures living in it are plagued by the results of study. And
the driving forces behind all this are economic, political and
national interests, the interests of various groups, racial
conflicts, and so on, which are carried beyond all reasonable
bounds as the result of study.
_Alas, the world has become a wilderness without end,_ said
Lao Tzu, and the truth of his words is clearly evident today.
Nowadays, it is no longer possible for our children to enjoy
absolutely healthy and unpolluted food. What an outrage!
What a worry!
Or do you, too, allow yourself to be deluded by the lies of
officialdom — all those carefully crafted falsehoods for-
mulated through study, refined with the techniques of applied
psychology and disseminated via advertising and the various
information bureaux The world has become a wilderness,
and now, scientists are even trying to involve other worlds in
this wasteland. There is no end to it! Do you see how
humankind is teetering on the brink of an abyss
There are some people who cannot accept these conclu-
sions. They think we are painting much too grim a picture,
that we are pessimists. It was just the same in Lao Tzu's time.
He says `The multitude rejoice and are glad. The multitude
have enough and to spare. The common people possess
sparkling lucidity, penetrative insight. In all things they have
their reasons, their arguments, acquired and developed
through rational study. Apparently, I alone am foolish. I alone
am mournfully anxious. I alone am dark. I am a chaos of con-
fusion, as one who has lost everything.' Yet, for the person in
Lao Tzu's position, all worries have ceased. Only one concern
remains, a concern that will not, cannot leave him the


```
THE WORLD HAS BECOME A WILDERNESS
```
concern for the whole of humankind, which has made this
entire day of manifestation into a hell, a wilderness. Through
study! Through worldly knowledge, applied without even a
spark of wisdom. So we beg you not to make the mistake so
many other people have made, the mistake of thinking that
knowledge is the same as wisdom. If you have understood
even the smallest particle of what Lao Tzu really meant, you
will know that not only is a new approach to life necessary,
but also a total self-revolution. With anything less, you will
achieve nothing!
This concerns the third aspect of the Tao Te Ching the
application of universal wisdom. The crucial thing is not what
you know, but what you do! You need to undertake a self-
revolution so radical, so total, that it can be called all-
encompassing. Your goodwill and love for the School and the
Gnosis are clearly evident. But in addition, it is crucial that
you, as a modern human being of this age, are able to begin
and carry through this radical self-revolution. And to do it,
you will need an intelligence born not of fanaticism, but of
wisdom. For this radical revolution, which is so necessary,
will need to affect not only yourself, but also everything and
everyone for whom you are responsible.
There is no uniform program that can be laid down for this
radical self-revolution; no set formula that can be followed and
applied by everyone. It is, first and foremost, an inner event.
However, it expresses itself outwardly as a totally new style of
living, based on life's true purpose. And that life-style has
characteristics which are clearly recognisable.
You will have to make the imperishable Kingdom the most
important thing in your life. For that, too, knowledge is
necessary, but it must be knowledge that is founded on the
wisdom which is of God. This self-revolution, which includes
everything you have understood until now as pertaining to the


```
THE WORLD HAS BECOME A WILDERNESS
```
state of the true pupil, the state of being of the living soul, will
be able to save the whole group from perdition.
Now, you know about how wisdom can be attained, how
the pupil can open the fount of wisdom. It is by walking the
path that leads to life, the path we have been telling you
about for so many years. Well then, if that fount of wisdom
had been opened in you, so that it could flow into your head
sanctuary, disclosing itself to your cognitive faculty,
vivifying the various centres latent within it and purifying all
its damaged aspects, then straight away an intense conflict
would arise. There would be a dissonance between you and
the whole world, between you and the whole of humankind
and its ways. As a new human being, you would no longer be
able to live as they do, despite any effort you might make to
adapt yourself to their ways as far as possible.
That is why joy is felt in the work-field when the
symptoms of this dissonance appear in the life of a pupil.
Because, through the application of worldly knowledge, the
whole world has been thrown into chaos; it has become a
wilderness. Every concession you make to the ways of that
world will deprive you more and more of the fruits of
pupilship and add to your share of world-karma. It will
prolong your imprisonment, as well as giving you a whole
series of new worries, which will make you feel as if you had
been cast into hell.
So do you see how urgent it has become for both the group
and individual pupils to take strenuous action A new page has
been turned in our book of life. What will we read on it Will
the group be able to fulfil its task
The whole world has become a wilderness and there is still
no end in sight. We can see that quite plainly! But the problem
is that the wilderness, and the results of the application of
worldly knowledge, are in many respects preventing the


```
THE WORLD HAS BECOME A WILDERNESS
```
process of pupilship from generating lasting new values;
they are blocking the ascent into freedom. The path of the
Rosa Mystica, which has been and is still being explored
right through to the spirit-soul field, is being deliberately
obstructed.
That is why action must be taken, by us and by the
group, so that all who wish to ascend the path upwards
may do so. If you consider how few possibilities of
positive development are now left to humankind, you will
realise how imminent the impending cosmic revolution
must be. And only through self-revolution will you be able
to survive it.


# 20 - III

## 20— III I alone am different from the common people

```
The twentieth chapter of the Tao Te Ching ends with the
sentence I alone am different from the common people,
because I revere the Mother who nourishes all things.
This is a clear statement of the immeasurable difference in
orientation between someone who has attuned himself
entirely to the nature of death, and someone who keeps his
heart focused on the nature of life.
The `Mother' referred to here is the field of pure, immacu-
late astral substance which concentrates around any domain
in which divine sparks are to grow. In this field currents
flow, and from it, radiations emanate. That is why the sacred
scriptures of all times speak of `the boundless ocean of
primordial substance', and `the water of life'. The Book of
Revelations mentions `the pure river of the water of life,
clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the
Lamb.' From this mighty fount of life all children of God
need to be nourished. From this power alone is `the' life to be
explained. Without this power of life no manifested
phenomenon can really be called `living'.
It is understandable, justifiable and natural that this astral
plenitude should be called `the Mother'. From this Mother, the
whole of creation must be brought forth, and it is by means of
this Mother-power that the Father's plan of creation needs to
become a reality. From the Father radiate divine sparks,
microcosms, containing the spirit of God. The divine spark is
the divine seed. Everything that lies enclosed in this divine
spark must come to maturity, to manifestation, through
contact with the World-Mother — the astral field of the true
```

```
I ALONE AM DIFFERENT FROM THE COMMON PEOPLE
```
life. From the Mother, through the seed of the Father, the
childship, the sonship becomes a glorious reality.
Lao Tzu lives from this Mother. He reveres the Mother
who nourishes all things. But why does that make him so
entirely different from his fellow human beings You can
give the answer to this question yourself. Earthly human
beings do not derive what they need to live from the astral
field of the World Mother. They originate from and are main-
tained by the astral field of the false mother, the astral field
of the nature of death. The aims and motives to which they
are bound, their approach to life and its results, are quite
different from those of people who worship and serve the
true World-Mother.
So it is understandable that the ordinary, earthly human
being, who is born without any wisdom and has only been
equipped with the ability to understand things intellectually,
can only acquire and store worldly knowledge; knowledge
obtained and expanded by experimental means. But this kind
of knowledge is devoid of wisdom and therefore invariably
leads to the abyss, turning the world into a wilderness, as Lao
Tzu says.
So there is a tremendous contrast between the two human
types the ordinary, earthly human being and the figure of Lao
Tzu. Both possess a microcosm; both emanate from a divine
spark. But only one, Lao Tzu, lives out of the astral field of the
World-Mother, in which the spirit of God is manifested and
makes itself directly knowable. In that astral field, the real
child of God, the true human being, is generated from the
divine spark, and the wisdom which is of God Himself can be
linked directly and absolutely with the cognitive apparatus and
can make use of it. Not a single aspect or effect of one's
approach to life will then be speculative or disappointing any
longer. From step to step, and from power to power, one's life


```
I ALONE AM DIFFERENT FROM THE COMMON PEOPLE
```
will manifest the glory of God and of His plan for His children.
Compare that with the other type of human being. Is he a
human being He is not! He is imprisoned in the nature of
death, sundered from the World-Mother. His manifestation, his
development, has stagnated. He is the cripple, the lame one, the
blind one, who must be healed. `Seeing, he is blind, and
hearing, he is deaf', as Jesus the Lord says. He is unborn.
Many people who are only able to cognise intellectually
and have acquired some esoteric knowledge in the course of
the years deceive themselves with the hope that the earthly
human being, even though seriously damaged, will eventu-
ally reach perfection by some roundabout route. They still
think it is possible to rely on advancement through study.
But let us understand Lao Tzu correctly. Only a total
revolution on the path can save earthly humanity. Only by
reversing the alignment of one's being, so that it is focused
entirely on the World-Mother, on the saving astral field of the
beginning, can the human race be helped.
The way that leads to this is known to you; it is shown to
you daily in the Spiritual School. Begin, then, by clearing the
chief obstruction out of the way, the false assumption that
worldly knowledge, and not the wisdom which is of God, can
help you. The practice of both is impossible. They cannot be
combined. So _Abandon study, and your worries will cease._

```
The visible effects of the great Te are engendered by the
emanations of Tao. They are the nature of Tao. With this
quotation from the ancient Chinese wisdom we would like to
begin our discussion of chapter 21 of the Tao Te Ching.
This chapter deals mainly with an explanation of the terms
Tao and Te. What Lao Tzu meant here can best be
understood by referring back to last verse of chapter 20
I alone am different from the common people, because I
revere the Mother who nourishes all things.
```
```
In the last chapter we said that the word `Mother' in this verse
means the original, absolutely pure astral field of the begin-
ning, in which the Father manifests himself completely. This
original astral field has not disappeared. It still exists; it is
inviolable. This is something anyone approaching the gnostic
path needs to be keenly aware of from moment to moment.
The great World Mother is inviolable. The space from which,
in which and through which reality must arise, is immaculate.
As soon as a human being, a group of human beings, or a
whole human lifewave deviates even slightly from the origi-
nal, divine plan of genesis, the astral field of that individual,
group or lifewave is immediately separated from the original
astral field so that what is different cannot spoil the original
in a denaturing sense. This process of separation is a
universal law, which safeguards the divine manifestation on
the one hand, and the element of freedom on the other.
Such an astral separation could, in a way, be called a `fall',
but it is not a fall in the absolute sense. It is quite common for
```

```
IN ITS CREATION, TAO IS INDEFINITE AND DIFFICULT TO TRACE
```
the astral states of individuals, groups and lifewaves of
human beings, as well as the astral states prevailing on the
various celestial bodies, to differ from each other and from
the astral state of the World Mother, but one can really only
speak of a `fall' when the element of evil predominates and
the attempt is made to turn fleeting, transient things into
static, permanent things.
If such a state arises — as is the case with our humanity —
the separation becomes very sharply accentuated. Between our
nature of death and the original nature of life there lies an
enormous gulf, a gaping abyss. And what happens then you will
know only too well, both from experience and from the
teachings of our School.
The astral field from which and in which a human being
lives, corresponds minutely with his actual state of being. All
his experiences, everything that happens in his life, all his
desires, thoughts and actions are the result of the state of his
astral life-sphere. So if a person's astral field has developed
highly individual characteristics, that person will be some-
thing of an outsider, and the afflictions and experiences he
undergoes in an astral field that deviates from that of the
World Mother will be equally individual.
However, if the person's approach to life has much in
common with that of the majority of humankind, if he does
more or less as the masses do, he will be struck by the full
force of the collective fate. That is why there we speak not
only of individual karma, but also group karma and
collective or world karma.
Another point we must mention is the certainty that it is
the law of freedom, itself, which ensures that the World
Mother remains inviolable. Imagine the human race strays
from the original plan (and, as you know, `all have gone
astray'). As soon as that happens, a separate astral field


```
IN ITS CREATION, TAO IS INDEFINITE AND DIFFICULT TO TRACE
```
arises in which a dialectical development unfolds; a process of
rising, shining and declining which always results in the
dissolution of everything unholy or moribund, so that it is
repeatedly brought back to the original point of deviation. This
deviation can then easily be eliminated at the dawn of a
subsequent day of manifestation.
So no astral field which deviates from that of the World
Mother will ever be able to violate, eclipse or destroy the
All-Manifestation as a whole. Every deviation brings about
its own end and receives the chance to begin anew and return
to the original. That is why Lao Tzu, who had restored his
connection with the original astral field, said

_I alone am different from the common people, because I revere
the Mother who nourishes all things._

Chapter 21 of the Tao Te Ching begins by explaining how a
striving human being can celebrate this return. More especi-
ally, it shows the scientifically incontestable conditions on
which such a return must be based, and these are what we
would like to discuss with you now.

_The visible effects of the great Te are engendered by the
emanations of Tao._

Imagine a person — such as a pupil of the young Gnosis —
who decides to walk the path of return. It is certain that he will
only be able to do this if he detaches himself completely from
the astral field of the nature of death and turns towards the
astral field of the World Mother. That is the primary precon-
dition. And it is fulfilled by a total revolution in your life, a
revolution which has three aspects.
Your birth in nature means that you are surrounded, firstly,
by your own personal astral field, which determines the
individual characteristics of your astral body.


IN ITS CREATION, TAO IS INDEFINITE AND DIFFICULT TO TRACE
Secondly, you are linked with a particular group of human
beings who are of your type. The size of this group will vary,
and the connecting characteristics may take the form of
material things, desires, I-central aims, nationality or some
other attribute.
Thirdly you are linked with humanity as a whole.
So you are imprisoned in your own astral field, in that of
the group to which you belong, and in that of human society
in general. Therefore, if the revolution you are aiming at as a
pupil of the Spiritual School is to succeed, it will have to be
threefold. You will need to dissolve your existing astral con-
ditions on three levels, and link yourself completely to the
original astral field of the Mother of Life, as Lao Tzu advises.
Otherwise you will only succeed in shifting the accents of
your life within the framework of the nature of death.
Imagine how it would be if people were to become pupils of
our School without undertaking this inner revolution; if they
were to confine themselves to becoming vegetarian, and
giving up smoking and using alcohol; if all they did was
mimic dogmatically the ways of speaking, feeling and think-
ing they saw exemplified in our School, and adopt a few ideas
and social habits consistent with pupilship. The result would
be that they would indeed form a new group together, but ...
within the framework of the nature of death. So they would
form the kind of group of which there are already so many in
the world. And they would have not the slightest effect on the
sting of death within them, the real cause of their imprison-
ment. For their character, inner state, behaviour and general
disposition would remain precisely the same as they were
before. All they would have achieved together would be to
create the need for yet another graveyard. Apart from the
Roman Catholic and Protestant graveyards, not to mention the
Jewish and municipal cemeteries, there would then be the


```
IN ITS CREATION, TAO IS INDEFINITE AND DIFFICULT TO TRACE
```
need for a graveyard for people who call themselves
`Rosicrucian'. But in essence, they would not differ from other
people in any way.
So why was Lao Tzu so different Well, his veneration of
the Original Mother, the Mother of the true child of God, has
to do with a threefold, inner revolution, with freeing oneself
in a threefold way from the astral imprisonment in which one
lives. This revolutionary process is combined with a
measureless yearning for the original astral field, a yearning
which arises in the heart of the person concerned, and
becomes more and more intense.
Now you may be thinking, `What an awesome task! How
difficult it must be!' But to think that would be the greatest
mistake of your life. If the yearning we are talking about is
really growing in the heart, then at the same time there will also
be the power, the ability, the profound gladness and all the
insight necessary to take the measures required, as well as the
surety that they will be completely successful. This might
involve, for instance, withdrawing from some social position
that was hindering your pupilship, or breaking all sorts of other
bonds and taking quite radical measures to adapt your life to
the consequences of pupilship.
Having heard this, many people are likely to conclude that
the gnostic working hypothesis is too vague to be practised
reliably in a world like ours. `Can we really take the respon-
sibility, for ourselves and for our family, of putting into prac-
tice this threefold gnostic revolution The guidelines you have
given are too vague, too confusing.' `Oh, how vague...!'
But Lao Tzu replies _The visible effects of the great Te are
engendered by the emanations of Tao. They are the nature of
Tao._ For people still focused on this nature, people whose
options are therefore limited to the choice of which graveyard
to be buried in, Tao is, in its creation, utterly vague and diffi-


```
IN ITS CREATION, TAO IS INDEFINITE AND DIFFICULT TO TRACE
```
cult to pin down. It couldn't be more so. And neither is anything
else to be expected in an astral field sundered from the
Primordial Mother. _And yet, at the heart_ - of Tao's creation- _all
images are contained._
Reflect on these words, and then any vagueness you
experience with respect to the practice of pupilship will, quite
literally, be swept away.


# 21 - ii

## 21— II Tao, the great power at the heart of all things

```
The visible effects of the great Te are engendered by the
emanations of Tao. These effects constitute the nature of
Tao. The presence of Tao in its creation is extremely
difficult to trace and understand for human beings born of
this nature. Indeed, it couldn't be more vague or elusive.
That is inevitable in a field of life separated from the
Primordial Mother. Nevertheless, at the heart of Tao's
creation, all images are contained.
Some writers translate the expression the great Te as `the
great virtue'. And although Te is indeed a great virtue, it is
more accurate to translate it as `the path of liberation' or `the
result of following the path of liberation'. By approaching
the essence of Te in this way, we avoid considering the great
virtue as an aspect of life in this nature. Many things in the
nature of death can be called virtuous and good, but the
virtue and goodness of this nature are not absolute. They are
not what Hermes Trismegistus calls `the Only Good'.
So the visible effects referred to in chapter 21 of the Tao
Te Ching are the result of walking the path, the result of
putting into practice the threefold gnostic revolution
discussed in the last chapter. These effects do not need to be
the slightest bit vague, for they are engendered by the
emanations of Tao.
Tao is the Divine One, the Absolute; it is `It', itself. But
isn't that definition rather vague It does not need to be, for
three reasons. Firstly, these emanations are the nature of Tao.
Secondly, Tao is present `at the heart of things'. Thirdly, this
```

```
TAO, THE GREAT POWER AT THE HEART OF ALL THINGS
```
heart of things contains `all images' within it. Let us try to
understand this.

Throughout the entire All-Manifestation, throughout the whole
of creation, Tao, the divine One is immanent. In this
unfathomable space countless astral fields exist, all of them
very different from one another. And with respect to every bit
of this diversity, all of it included in the oneness, it must be said
that `Tao is present at the heart of things.'
That fact alone is very significant and comforting. But it is
even more important to be able to state that emanations radiate
from this divine power `at the heart of things', emanations
whose majesty permeates the whole of unfathomable space.
The significance of this becomes even more striking when
one realises that all those myriads of celestial bodies, from the
largest galaxy, zodiacal system or solar system down to the
smallest planetary body, possess Tao at their centre, in the most
literal sense.
Every planet, every sun, every system is surrounded and
interpenetrated by the spiritual essence of Tao. That essence
is brought to a focus at the heart of each of those heavenly
bodies and systems. So the planet we inhabit carries Tao in
its heart, in the most absolute sense. That is why it is said
that the Christ-Spirit dwells in the central stratum of our
planet. Having said this, we need to clarify the distinction
between the Planetary Spirit and the Planetary Logos.
The Planetary Spirit is the expression of the dialectical
aspect, the image-bearer of the planetary nature of death. We
could compare the planet we know as Earth with the persona-
lity of the human being. The Planetary Logos, however, is the
indwelling Tao-existence, the existence of the true Earth,
born of God, which can be compared with the microcosm. It
is the Heaven-Earth referred to in the Apocalypse, a planet


```
TAO, THE GREAT POWER AT THE HEART OF ALL THINGS
```
which is quite different from the one known to us, and which
is nevertheless very near to us.
A still more amazing fact is that Tao is present not only at
the heart of every cosmos and macrocosm, but at the heart of
the microcosm, too. Remember the Hermetic axiom, `as above
so below'. Tao is also present at the heart of the microcosm,
concentrated at a point which coincides with the physical
heart. At this point, the emanations of Tao are very clearly
distinguishable.
So we have shown you, at least in brief, the nature of Tao.
Tao is everywhere, at the heart of everyone and everything.
That is the great miracle of Tao. This great, living, divine
power speaks and lives and radiates in the heart of everyone
and everything. So that is the wonderful nature of Tao, the
divine attribute.
`Then why,' you may ask, `is the voice of Tao so vague
within me! Why am I confused about it'
Because Tao is indeed _in_ you, but it is not _of_ you. Tao is not
embodied in you; it has no part in your material existence.
Your existence, your personality, has its own consciousness,
its own voice. You are from another nature, and the divine
nature is only distinguishable in you as a voice, a radiation. It
is the Word, which was, and is, from the beginning.
If a person is focused exclusively on this nature, if he is
satisfied with that, if he is absorbed only in that and does
not even know about the possibility of another nature whose
voice resounds in him, then it is logical that he will not
understand that voice and will only find it confusing.
If someone does know about the presence of the other
nature, but does not adapt himself to it by changing his
approach to life, he will find Tao not only confusing but also
extremely elusive. In such a situation, the light, the Word,
has appeared in the darkness, but the darkness cannot


```
TAO, THE GREAT POWER AT THE HEART OF ALL THINGS
```
or does not want to comprehend it. Do you see how explicit
the prologue of the Gospel of John is
If you want to free yourself from this confusion and turn
Tao's elusiveness into clear light, you may never forget that
throughout the All-Manifestation there are always two
natures the absolute nature, which is Tao, and a nature in
genesis, which is not or has not yet become Tao. So, with
respect to the microcosm, there are two lives a divine nature
and a nature in genesis, whose development may well have
stagnated — as yours has — and consequently keeps on
being brought back to the point of departure the wheel of
birth and death.
And remember, if there are two natures, there must also be
two separate states of consciousness, that of the nature in
genesis, and that of the absolute nature; the consciousness of
the personality and the consciousness of the microcosm.
The lower state of consciousness must make room for and
merge into the other one. This particularly applies to the state
of consciousness of any being which exists in a stagnated
nature, in a nature which has become evil. His state of con-
sciousness must be broken up, in order to make room for the
divine nature, so that one day the liberated entity may pro-
nounce the words `The Father and I are one.'
We are telling you things you have probably known for a long
time, but our aim is to make them truly alive for you at this
moment. We want you to realise that the Lord of All is to be
found — at this very moment — in your innermost being, in the
stable of your dialectical self; it is to be found not only in the
midst of this temple, but also at the heart of your microcosm.
In the past you may well have lost yourself in labyrinths of
vagueness and confusion. So now, let yourself understand the
words of Lao Tzu


```
TAO, THE GREAT POWER AT THE HEART OF ALL THINGS
```
_Yet, at the heart of creation, all images are contained. Oh
how vague, how intangible! Yet, at the heart of all things, the
spiritual being is present. This being is of the utmost reality
and contains the infallible testimony._

Could it be expressed in a more concrete way than in Lao
Tzu's holy language From the heart of Tao flows the divine
spiritual essence, the divine Voice, the divine Word. This
Voice, this Word, contains the entire plan.
The characters of the divine Word consist of images, of
concrete impressions. From the central principle of the
microcosm, the rose of the heart, there emanates a radiant
light-power, which bears within it a treasury of images of
the great reality which will have to be realised in and by the
human being. Just think of how radio and television work.
Though a very mundane analogy, it will help you
understand what an enormous wealth of images and sounds
are transmitted by the heart of Tao, so that they can be
perceived by any human being whose instrumentarium has
been attuned to them.
The divine picture-language is being spoken to you all the
time; it is being transmitted constantly, from the heart of
things. The same divine language speaks in all of us, which
gives us a means of comparison, of authentication. This
language is spoken to us by the Planetary Logos (remember
not the Planetary Spirit). In short, this Word, this speech, is
being transmitted to you from countless directions.
This Word contains all true knowledge. And, as Lao Tzu
says, it conveys an infallible testimony with respect to the
genesis of the entire All, explaining how this genesis needs to
unfold, where it is going wrong, and how it can be put right
again. The solution to every problem you place before


```
TAO, THE GREAT POWER AT THE HEART OF ALL THINGS
```
the inner tribunal of the microcosm, cosmos and macrocosm,
is transmitted to you in multidimensional images, which are
then transmuted into images you can recognise and
understand.
Everyone who, in this way, approaches the Lord in the Midst,
participates in the university of the divine world. Only the
knowledge acquired there constitutes an infallible testimony.
That is why Lao Tzu says in chapter 20 `Free yourself from
knowledge, and your worries will cease.' Only divine
knowledge, put into practice, will benefit the world and
humankind and be of service to the plan.
Can you now see why we are urging you to do everything
possible to allow the spiritual being within you to speak, so
that the light of its infallible testimony can shine It is a
testimony from the most ancient past, and it will last forever.
It is a power through which the true creation can be brought
into existence. This creation is produced in a completely
natural, scientific way, by means of a process which can be
followed to the letter by the candidate of the holy science,
because the entire process of rebirth has its origin in Tao.
And Tao is in your innermost being, imparting to you its
power and enabling you to understand it by means of its
image-forming capacity.


### 21 - iii

### Rebirth in Tao

It is said that Lao Tzu wrote nine hundred and thirty books
about ethics and religion and seventy about esotericism. But
of all those works and the copies made of them, nothing
remains. They have vanished without a trace. The only one
of Lao Tzu's works still extant is the Tao Te Ching, a brief
document of some five thousand words, covering twelve
pages or so. Often, this text is virtually impossible to under-
stand. And maybe that is why it has been spared the fate of
the others.
It is the same old story. The primordial adversary, which has
taken so many forms since the beginning of time, did as it
always does, using every available means to destroy any doc-
uments which appear to threaten the continued existence of the
nature of death or which contain information about the reality
of the two natures. You probably know what many Chinese
scholars say about the Tao Te Ching, and you also know what
we think of their interpretations. Yet many extensive
commentaries on the Tao Te Ching are to be found in the
libraries of the Far East. More often than not, these com-
mentaries have been garbled and are bound to be misleading.
So we should not be too hard on scholars who consult such
sources. Indeed, over the centuries, many people have fallen
victim to the adversary because of this kind of thing. For it is a
fact that, in the nature of death, everything possible is done to
erase any traces of the divine messengers.
So there is but one way, one method, of removing all the
obscurity and confusion that stands between you and the great
reality. It is the way, the method, we have been explaining.


```
REBIRTH IN TAO
```
You need to approach the actual nature of Tao, which exists in
the centre of your being. In self-surrender of the heart, and in
profound yearning, you need to approach the nature of Tao
within you. Then you will discover that there really is an
infallible, divine testimony, a Kingdom of God within you.
Since the most distant past, says Lao Tzu, the divine essence,
which is so near to us, has been imperishable. And it is that
divine essence which can bring about genuine creation, the
rebirth of what is true and real.

So let us take a brief look at how this process of creation can
unfold in someone who puts the threefold gnostic method into
practice
First of all the person needs to withdraw from his own astral
field, which belongs to the nature which deviates from the
divine; secondly, he needs to dissociate from the astral field of
the group to which he belongs as a result of his birth in this
nature; thirdly, he needs to dissolve any astral ties there may be
between himself and the astral field of the nature of death as a
whole.
At first sight this threefold assignment seems like an un-
scalable wall, barring our way. Yet is it the same task that
has been carried out by all the great ones throughout history,
by all the children of God. It is exactly the path that Jesus the
Lord exemplified on his _via dolorosa._ The Kingdom He
sought and found was not `of this world'. That is why He
made his paths straight; why He immersed himself in the
waters of the Jordan, the river of life, and why He overcame
the astral adversary.
So if you want to become a real follower of Christ — and
you can, because the Kingdom of God is within you — you
must make a concrete beginning. With an all-encompassing
desire in which your whole heart is absorbed, you must turn


```
REBIRTH IN TAO
```
towards the `Lord in your Midst'. If you cannot yet summon
that kind of desire, or if it costs you a great deal of effort —
well, then your time has not yet come. No one can force you
to produce that boundless longing of the heart. You cannot
achieve it by means of exercises or through an intellectual
decision. It is a state of being, rather like being in love.
If you have ever really loved someone, or been loved by
someone, you will know that the whole heart can be absorbed
and uplifted by it. This gives rise to an emanation, which
radiates from the heart and establishes the connecting link.
Well, it is with a love like that, that the heart must devote itself
to the spiritual rose, which is present in the heart, in the centre,
of your being. Then, because the rose is so very near to you and
has been waiting for you for such a long time, a powerful
connection will come into being between you. Then the
foundation for soul-rebirth will have been laid. That is why the
Bible says that only love can set you free.
Once this foundation for rebirth is firmly in place, the
power of Tao will be able to enter the whole personality-
system, so that the nature of Tao can perform its work. Then
it is only necessary for the person who is permitted to
undergo this miracle to keep his whole heart in the light of
Tao, and not allow his heart's desire-orientation to wander
into the highways and byways of the nature of death. This
will systematically disconnect the whole personality from all
its astral ties with the nature that deviates from God. A divine
creation will come into existence!
Perhaps you are still wondering, `How will I know for cer-
tain that such a rebirth really has its origin in Tao Couldn't I be
mistaken'
Lao Tzu gives the answer `Dear friend, you will know, from
day to day and from hour to hour, with unfailing certainty,
through Tao itself'. When, in love, you have found and


```
REBIRTH IN TAO
```
met the God within you, this Lord in the centre of your
being will speak to you unceasingly in His picture-
language. The `secret communion' with the All-Highest will
then have been attained, for all eternity.





_What is imperfect will become perfect. What is crooked will
become straight. What is empty will become full. What is
worn out will become new._

_With little, `It' is gained. With much, one deviates from `It'._

_That is why the sage holds fast to the One, and in this way
makes himself into an example for the world._

_Not seeking to shine, he is enlightened. Not overrating him-
self, he is distinguished. Not boasting, he has merit. Not
wanting to be first, he is superior. Standing in non-conflict,
he is unconquerable._

_When the ancients said, `What is imperfect will become
perfect', how could this have been an empty phrase When
someone has attained perfection, everything must yield to
him._

Tao Te Ching chapter 22
```

# 22 - i

## 22— I The four great possibilities

```
The individual chapters of the Tao Te Ching can best be
understood when seen in the context of the book as a whole. So
we would like to look at chapter 22 in the light of what was said
in some of the preceding verses.
These showed that, right in centre of every microcosm, at a
point coinciding with the heart sanctuary of the material
human being, dwells `the essence of the Spirit'. This centre,
this rose of the heart, gives life to true creation, to the rebirth
of spirit, soul and body. Whenever a human being finds `the
way', recognises `the truth' and lives `the life', such a victory
is inevitable. That is why, in chapter 22, Lao Tzu can state as
an axiom that
```
```
What is imperfect will become perfect. What is crooked will
become straight. What is empty will become full. What is worn
out will become new.
It is absolutely certain that the divine plan for the world and
humankind will be successful, and this is what Lao Tzu is
making clear to his pupils. The concise language of the Tao
Te Ching, with its briefly formulated lessons in which every-
thing is said using the minimum of words, is clearly not
aimed at the average person, but at Lao Tzu's pupils and
fellow workers, the emissaries of the Universal Chain and
their helpers. Such workers have an arduous labour to
perform, in the course of which they are quite likely to lose
courage, and even, at times, to be overcome by sorrow.
This psychological state is also described in the gospels and
may overtake any worker in the vineyard from time
```

```
THE FOUR GREAT POSSIBILITIES
```
to time. It is to such people that the teacher's words are
addressed

_What is imperfect will become perfect. What is crooked will
become straight. What is empty will become full. What is worn
out will become new._

These words give every worker new courage to persevere and
keep going, whatever the circumstances, for every child of
God will, and indeed must, reach the ultimate goal. The path
to perfection will be found by everyone, and everyone will
`make straight the paths'; the empty will be filled by every-
one, and the result will be victory what was worn out, will be
renewed.
All who have approached the Spiritual School and have
accepted pupilship have obviously become potential fellow
labourers in the great work. This work is totally devoted to the
imperfect, the crooked, the empty and the worn out, so as to
make it whole and be of service to it.
That is why you need to see `the four great possibilities'
clearly before you. These four possibilities are referred to in the
Buddha's philosophy, for instance, as `the four noble truths'.
The four possibilities Lao Tzu is talking about can be put into
words as follows

1 the way of perfection,
2 making straight the paths,
3 filling what is empty,
4 the renewing process of transfiguration.

If you want to unlock these four possibilities (which, ultima-
tely, are certainties), you will need to approach them in this
order, because that is the order in which they unfold.
When you first read verse one of chapter 22 you may have
thought that it was meant to be encouraging only in a kind of


```

```
mystical way, in the sense of `Just persevere, just keep going,
and everything will turn out fine,' in which case it would not be
so important what was said, or how it was said, for it would
simply be an expression of loving concern `Don't worry. The
crooked will be made straight in the end.'
But no, there is more to it than that. The nature of these
words, the order in which they are expressed, and hence
their structure, is in keeping with a law of the divine nature
which governs the way in which creation and creatures are
manifested. This is what we know as far as God's creature, the
human being, is concerned
After a period of preparation, called involution, the human
being is faced with a task, called evolution. Contrary to what
many people think, evolution is not an automatic process.
Evolution does not just happen by itself; the human being
needs to enable it to happen, through his own efforts. He
needs to magnify the divine aim, in himself, and by himself,
voluntarily, and in understanding and love.
That is why the human being is offered the way of perfection
at the beginning of the path of self-realisation, the way
of magnifying the God within. The human being is
informed about the whole plan. This is what is meant by the
statement that `what is imperfect will be made perfect'.
Everyone who is really ready for it, will see the way of
perfection before him.
The plan that is then unveiled, must be put into practice. It
must be fulfilled by the individual himself, in free will and
devotion, with an all-consuming interest and profound love.
The presence of the spiritual essence in the centre of every
human system means that everyone is capable of attaining the
goal. But whenever any individual does not do so, or does not
want to, the laws of the counternature will immediately come
into effect. These laws are always self- correcting. If


```

```
necessary, the whole nature of death will function in this way,
in order to keep on bringing the entity concerned back to the
sublime reason innate in his divine spark.
So the way of perfection is, and has always been, present
in the centre of your being. Its sublime rationale is eternal and
always remains the same. But what if, undergoing the results
of deviation from the divine plan, you have gone so far astray
that you have `forgotten' it What if you are structurally
denatured to such an extent that, when you are confronted
with the path of perfection, you can no longer understand it
and at best perceive it in a very obscure way Then what you
need most is to be shown the path of perfection time and time
again, and to have all its aspects illuminated for you one after
the other.
When the personality, born of the counternature and bound
to it, has been buffetted so much by it that his lower nature is
quite exhausted, he may at last hear the fervent cry coming
from the primordial atom in the heart. Then the dark cloud that
lies between the sublime reason of Tao `which is in the midst'
and the defeated heart of the personality, can be swept away
and the seeking person will once again see face to face the way
of perfection.
One of the propositions from Spinoza's _Ethics_ states that `A
person who is motivated by fear and thus does good out of fear
of evil is not guided by reason. However, a person who is
touched by the reason that exists at the heart of things will
never experience anything else than feelings of joy and intense
yearning.'
Imagine how it would be if you had been so crushed and
shocked by life that you had fled into the School of the
Rosycross out of fear of even worse suffering, and that you
had become a pupil because you were in the grip of this
intense fear. Then, when you were told about gnostic phi-


```
THE FOUR GREAT POSSIBILITIES
```
losophy, such a motive would not enable you to catch even
a single, momentary glimpse of the way of perfection lying
before you. It might even be so that the sublime reason
present in the centre of your being had never spoken to you
at all. Then the rose of the heart would still be completely
enclosed in its bud. Gnostic philosophy would carry no
meaning for you; it would have no power in you.
A School like ours is not in any way like a religion of this
nature because, as Spinoza says `Those who strive to keep
human beings under control through fear' - he means fear of an
avenging justice - `thus driving them to flee evil rather than
loving virtue, aim at nothing else than making others' lives as
disastrous as their own.'
That is why it is important for anyone who has come to the
end of his path in the nature of death, who has really landed
on the bottom of the pit of death and has seen his whole life
deteriorating through worry, fear and dread, through conflict
and self-maintenance, to consider from time to time whether
he is still acting out of an urge to seek new objects or
subjects of fear, worry and dread, and to keep on vivifying
new reasons to carry on some conflict or other.
If that is so, then the end of his passage through the land of
despair has not yet come. The nadir of his suffering has not yet
been reached.
However, when the psychological end really has come, a
silence, a state of resignation will arises. Then, through
your suffering, you will hear the voice of the rose, the voice
of the sublime reason which exists in the centre of your
being. Then there will be no further flight, but only joy and
yearning the person who is touched by reason, will never
experience anything else than feelings of joy and intense
yearning.
Why joy Because, for the first time, the way of perfec-


```
THE FOUR GREAT POSSIBILITIES
```
tion is opening up for him in all its beauty and radiance.
Why an intense yearning Because, after nameless
suffering and affliction, after being wounded in every fibre
of his being, the individual sees the wisdom and fullness of
the liberating life shining so clearly, and offering such vast
perspectives, that a boundless yearning to attain it seems to
make his heart leap with excitement.
Thus, in joy and yearning, the foundation for genuine
pupilship is laid. Then it is no longer difficult to decide
whether or not to accept the consequences of a new
approach to life. And, filled with almost boundless energy
and power, one will gladly make a start on the second
aspect of the fourfold process making straight the paths.



# 22 - ii

# The sage makes himself into

# an example for the world

From what we have been explaining, you will have been able
to see the path that leads to perfection, and thus to determine
whether your pupilship is genuine. You will have realised
that, for the genuine pupil, it is not at all difficult to `make the
paths straight'. Such pupils are deeply interested in these
things, and it comes quite naturally to them to grasp every
opportunity to follow the path of perfection they have seen
before them.
The process of `making the paths straight' is founded on
the practice of John-Rosicrucianism, which can be begun as
soon as the stage of inner illumination has been reached. In
this context, it is very interesting to note how closely the four
great possibilities mentioned in the text — _what is imperfect
will become perfect, what is crooked will become straight,
what is empty will become full, what is worn out will become
new —_ match the message of salvation which has been pro-
claimed by all the great world teachers.
Anyone who has strayed from the divine path must first be
able to see the true way, the one path. That is the first
requirement, and once it has been met, the pupilship of John
the Baptist can follow quite naturally. Indeed, it will _have_ to
follow. This phase consists solely of making the paths
straight — of making all the preparations necessary for the
great return. It means correcting anything that could possibly
obstruct one's return, by engaging in a very revolutionary,
new approach to life.
Only then does one become a real pupil of the gnostic


```
THE SAGE MAKES HIMSELF INTO AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD
```
Spiritual School. Or, to put it in the language of ancients only
then is one born in Nazareth, only then does one become a
Nazarene, which means a branch on the tree of life. Then one is
exempt, separated from the nature of death, and what is empty
will be filled.
The nature-born person is empty of the prana of life. So this
original astral radiation, the original life-energy of the Mother
of Life, needs to flow into the personality system again. In
this phase, the candidate is filled with a new soul-power what
was empty is filled anew with the energy of life.
Then the fourth great possibility can be applied _What is
worn out will become new._ The renewal of transfiguration will
unfold, and the truth of Lao Tzu's words will be revealed _With
little, `It' is gained. With much, one deviates from `It'._
Lao Tzu's manner of expression is so succinct that we need to
be careful not to trivialise it. For these words are in fact a
powerful expression of the gnostic path of self-realisation and
its intensely revolutionary character.
To become something as to the true self, one needs to
empty oneself completely as to the old self. One needs to
practise `not-being'. The whole culture of the realm of death
must be given up. The seeker must have the courage to
become insignificant, to diminish. _With little, `It' is gained.
With much, one deviates from `It'._
Then, by our diminishing, the Other One will be enabled to
increase. Then the voice of the rose of the heart will be able
to resound, and the meeting with `It', with Tao, can be
celebrated. _That is why,_ as Lao Tzu says, _the sage holds fast
to the One, and in this way makes himself into an example for
the world._ By practising John-Rosicrucianism, one will
indeed set a shining example in the world.
Lao Tzu now goes on to give more precise details about how
to diminish so that the Other One can increase

1 one does not seek to shine,
2 one does not overrate oneself,
3 one does not boast,
4 one does not want to be first,
5 one stands in non-conflict.

A person who is approaching the four great possibilities will
spontaneously fulfil this fivefold self-revolution.
The very self-assertive, nature-born person — and it is to
this kind of person that our text refers — is obsessed with the
urge for self-improvement. Nowadays, the majority of
people, especially in our present race, are very self-assertive.
This is yet another indication that the times of the end are
fast approaching.
When a nature-born person reaches the limit of his earthly
possibilities, there is either degeneration or a powerful urge
towards self-improvement. Among the masses, and among
those who are psychologically weak or morally defective, the
curve will quickly take a downward turn. But in very self-
assertive people — who have reached the limit but have no
knowledge of how matters really stand — a state of consider-
able tension will arise. They want to go further; they want to
achieve greater, more magnificent things. They are driven by
an urge for power — and then there is tension, because the
law of nature compels an absolute `halt'.
Motivated by this powerful urge, more and more people are
immersing themselves in intellectual study. This phenomenon
is apparent all over the world — a proof that self-
assertiveness has reached its limits, and that therefore the end
of a period has come. The pursuit of study is a high priority in
almost every country. The number of secondary schools,
institutes and universities is proliferating rapidly. The whole
education system is geared towards it. At the same


```
THE SAGE MAKES HIMSELF INTO AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD
```
time, the number of manual workers, the people who really
keep society going, is decreasing. Everywhere in the so-
called `civilised' world, the number of workers is diminishing
and there are labour-shortages which governments are
attempting to fill with `immigrant workers'. Meanwhile, the
number of graduates is increasing in virtually all fields of
study.
Of course, this is bound to lead to crisis situations. It is the
signature of the tension which has arisen in the borderland of
dialectical nature. As self-assertive nature-born human
beings, people want to shine. They want to take pride in their
achievements. They want to clothe their status, the cultural
level they have attained, with the glitter of prestige. They
exert themselves to the utmost to be the first, the best, the
greatest. The higher they can climb up the ladder of success,
the happier they are. It is no surprise that all this brings with
it an intense conflict, and extreme self-maintenance. In the
tension-field of the nature-born self-assertiveness the battle
for self-maintenance is raging on all fronts. Perhaps you, too,
are involved in it, to some extent
In this way, out of necessity brought on by the escalating
labour-shortage, the mechanical human being, the robot, will be
born, and the abyss will have been opened for all those
intellectuals, doctors and professors, who know everything
except the `one thing needful'.
You probably know all this better than we do. Perhaps you
are even at the forefront of it all, because of your position in
society. The world and humankind have already been through
many such phases. Are the words from chapter 22 of the Tao Te
Ching not drawn from the reality of our times
That is why, like us, you feel Lao Tzu's message to his
disciples as a heartfelt cry, sent out to make human beings
conscious of the one thing needful, to show them the four


THE SAGE MAKES HIMSELF INTO AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WORLD

great possibilities and make them realise the importance
of the fivefold self-revolution before it is too late, before
yet another cycle of human development ends in suicide.
Self-revolution or self-destruction, that is the issue facing
humankind!
That is why the sage, who understands, will dissociate
himself completely from all the competition and strife in
the tension-field of the dialectical world. He will reject
utterly the tendency to use any means to push his way to
the top and keep competitors at bay. He will follow the
path of the rose and the cross, which will lead him to
quite a different kind of wisdom. Then he will behold the
dawn of the true life, and discover that the limits have
disappeared. And, oh wonder, precisely in this way, by
consciously decreasing, `the Other' will be obtained.
In his non-conflict as to this nature there will
nonetheless be a clear, positive victory. It is precisely such
people who, in the service of humanity, will fulfil a great
task in this earthly vale of tears, the world of the nature of
death, and a place will be prepared for them in the pantheon
of the immortals. This is the meaning of the final words of
chapter 22

_When the Ancients said, `What is imperfect will become
perfect' , how could this have been an empty phrase
When someone has attained perfection, everything must
yield to him._



# 22 - iii

## 22— III The imperfect will become perfect

```
Perhaps you know the words of Jesus the Lord, from Luke
chapter 9, verse 24 `He who wishes to keep his life shall lose
it. But he who is willing to lose his life for my sake, shall keep
it.' In the Gospel according to Mark there is a small insertion
`He who is willing to lose his life for my sake and the sake of
the gospel, will keep it' (Mark 835).
After what we have said in the previous chapters, you will
easily recognise how closely these words match the contents
of the Tao Te Ching. Yet again we find proof that the eternal
truth has been proclaimed throughout all times. That is why
it could not possibly have been an empty phrase when the
Ancients, the sublime servants of the spirit, said What is
imperfect will become perfect — provided one follows the
right path and applies the correct method. The I must
decrease; the soul must increase. Then the true human being
will be able to manifest itself via the living soul. That is the
Universal Doctrine, the glad tidings which have been
transmitted throughout all times as an imperishable truth, a
gospel.
With this certainty — which no longer needs to be at all
uncertain for any pupil of the gnostic Spiritual School — as the
basis for our reflections, we would like to consider the closing
words of chapter 22 When someone has attained perfection,
everything must yield to him.
By practising the fivefold self-revolution, the four great
possibilities we have been discussing can gradually be
freed from their veils and turned into reality. Those who
```

```
THE IMPERFECT WILL BECOME PERFECT
```
are engaged in this process will experience that everything must
yield to them. In other words, they will be freed from
everything dialectical.
This is a miraculous event, and it is helpful to have some
idea of what it entails. A tool can prove its effectiveness only
if it is used, and only if it is applied in the right way will its
proper function be revealed. The human personality is such a
tool. It has the task of proving itself. But the tool keeps on
being wrongly applied, and so it is destroyed by death, and
keeps on having to be regenerated via birth in nature.
However, when the living soul begins to guide the
personality, death will become a thing of the past and birth in
nature will be overcome. Without the living soul-state the
personality is always incomplete and will remain so.
This sounds logical enough, so why doesn't humanity
understand it The cause lies in the fact that, when the per-
sonality is born, it is equipped with a natural state of con-
sciousness, and people mistake this natural consciousness for
the living soul-state. And that makes them think that any
shortcomings will gradually disappear if only the natural
consciousness is subjected to sufficient culture.
Alas, the nature-born human being will discover only after
deep, painful and mostly very prolonged experience that the
imperfect can never be made perfect unless all aspects of the
perfect have been brought together and enabled to function in
combination.
The great miracle of God's creation is that every aspect of the
perfect human being is alive in itself. This means that, in fact,
life is threefold, for there is the life of the personality, the life of
the soul and the life of the spirit. Only when these three are
combined, and each one is in the divinely intended condition,
will the true, divine human being be able to live.


THE IMPERFECT WILL BECOME PERFECT
If you understand this, and as a personality you are willing
to strive for this one great goal, then what the Ancients said
no longer needs to be an empty saying _The imperfect will
become perfect._ If any striving mortal truly sees before him
the threefold way to perfection and accepts the consequences,
everything and everyone will have to yield to him. Why, one
might ask. Can one be certain of that
The whole universe is moved by natural laws. There are
many laws in nature, and many effects produced by those
laws, which are suspended or reversed by the laws of the
higher nature. But the highest law is that of Tao itself. This
law causes, if necessary, the dissolution of everything not in
harmony with it. All the lower, all the undivine, everything
which is only to be explained from the personality-being,
must yield to the higher, which is of Tao itself.
Those who live in harmony with Tao, those who orientate
themselves towards Tao and make the three into one, are in
this way invested with great power — the greatest power in
heaven or on earth. There is no power which is higher than
that of the gnostic magician. That is why he stands in the
world as an authority.
Those who possess this power will not, of course, misuse
it by applying the cunning methods of the imperfect persona-
lity-being. The personality enforces his will, his decision, his
point of view, whenever the power or the opportunity to do
so comes his way. The gnostic human being, however, does
not fight; he does not battle against unwillingness, impotence
or inability. If he were to enter the battlefield in this way, it
would be of no benefit to him, seen in the light of perfection.
Moreover his own soul would suffer harm. `What doth it
profit a man, though he gain the whole world, but harm his
own soul'
You, as a pupil of the Spiritual School of the Golden


```
THE IMPERFECT WILL BECOME PERFECT
```
Rosycross, are a personality-being. You possess a soul, or at
least a soul in the making. And as a Lord in your midst, you
possess the nuclear power of your microcosm, the living rose.
Until these three have been combined completely into one, in
keeping with divine law, you are still imperfect.
But nothing and no one can prevent you from impelling the
imperfect to perfection, by following the path shown to you in
the Spiritual School. Everything, but everything, will then have
to yield to you in this!
If you walk this path, the words of Jesus, in Mark chapter 9,
will also apply to you `Verily, I say to you, there are those
among you who will not taste death until they have seen the
Kingdom of God come with power.'



_He who speaks little is spontaneous and natural._

_What is it that prevents high winds from lasting all morning
and heavy rains from lasting all day It is the activity of
heaven and earth. If heaven and earth cannot last long, how
much less can man._

_That is why he who conforms to Tao will become one with Tao.
He who conforms to virtue, will become one with virtue. He
who conforms to error, will become one with error._

_Being one with Tao means to obtain Tao. Being one with virtue
means to obtain virtue. Being one with error means to obtain
error._

_Not having sufficient faith means to have no faith at all._

Tao Te Ching chapter 23

```
## 23— I He who speaks little is spontaneous and natural

```
He who speaks little is spontaneous and natural. These words
of Lao Tzu will not seem strange to you, for you are familiar
with the periods of silence during our renewal conferences and
we have often spoken to you about the importance of being
silent. But you also know that much always lies hidden in Lao
Tzu's so very concise language. One single word of his often
lays open to us the whole of gnostic philosophy.
That is why we would like to devote more than superficial
attention to the first verse of chapter 23. If we want to try to
fathom the full depth of what Lao Tzu means here, we will need
to unveil the mystery of speech and sound.
The first thing you need to bear in mind is that human
speech is always closely connected with two processes the
process of breathing and the process of thinking. Unless you
breathe you cannot speak. Without a properly functioning mind
you cannot express any language in sound. The larynx — the
organ with which you bring forth articulated sounds — is of
relatively minor significance compared to the respiration and
the thought processes.
When various authors state that the human being can speak
and is distinguished from other animals because he has a per-
pendicular larynx, this is only a partial truth. For all the organs
of the material body are necessary if we are to function properly
in matter.
In both animal and human heads and hearts are several
minute organs which connect them directly with the astral
spheres. With many species of animals and human types it is
not so much the heart as the solar plexus which plays a large
```

```
HE WHO SPEAKS LITTLE IS SPONTANEOUS AND NATURAL
```
part in that process. This fundamental connection between the
living, material being and the astral sphere determines the
quality, the whole nature of the creature concerned.
The astral plane is not uniform throughout. It is made up of
countless domains, each one qualitatively different from all the
others, and in each one of these astral domains, countless
possibilities and situations are manifested. So it is easy to
understand that every human being possesses an individual
astral type, a personal astral key. This key is expressed in every
aspect of his being, and is present not only within him but also
around him. On this factor rests the whole nature and quality of
a person's breathing.
By this we mean to say that, even though we all live in the
same respiration field, in the same atmosphere, each of us
still possesses a highly individual, personal respiration-field,
which is formed and prepared by our personal astral con-
dition.
So with every breath we take, both the head and the heart
will function in a way determined by our astral condition at
that moment. In this way, life really does arise from breath, in
more than one sense. From our breath arise not only our men-
tal activities, but also our desires. There is an inner, astral
basis which arises via the chakras, and there is an outer astral
activity, which connects with the inner, astral basis via the
breath.
Whenever a thought is produced by the brain or a desire is
born in the heart, these emanate from the head and heart and
project themselves into the astral substance which surrounds us
on all sides, in the same way as a fish is surrounded by water.
These projections are then reflected back and in this way our
fundamental astral nature, our respiration field and our breath,
as well as our thought life and desire life, are kept within a
certain framework.


```
HE WHO SPEAKS LITTLE IS SPONTANEOUS AND NATURAL
```
Now imagine that thoughts and feelings are aroused in you
which do not correspond to your fundamental astral type;
they are alien to it. Then they will always have been caused
by some influence on your respiration-field, for the other
route, via the chakras and the etheric body, is too heavily
obstructed by the blood, the nerve fluid and the endocrine
system. So how do these influences and their subsequent
results penetrate into your respiration field Well, that
happens through speech. When a person speaks, he does so
during an exhalation. One does not speak when one is
inhaling. You can only do that in a forced way — artificially
— and only for a few brief moments, and your voice will
sound very unnatural.
When you inhale, the astral substance in your respiration
field enters your head and impels you to some sort of mental
activity. Then, on the outbreath, you use your voice. By
speaking, you activate the image, the power, the vibration
which the inhaled substance conveyed to you. You convert
the astral values into a living reality, which is magically
active. So speech becomes a creative act by means of the air
exhaled.
By dividing the exhaled air, the _prana,_ into various cur-
rents of vibration, in keeping with the thought-image behind
them, and in this way conducting the differentiated prana
outward via the larynx, the mental and thus the astral
become audible. They are converted into sound. Consonants
and vowels form words in magic characters, sound-images.
All these sound-images have their origin on the astral
plane. So this primary origin is invoked by the magic of
speech; it is vivified, liberated, activated. This activity, this
magic, naturally has results. These results may be helpful
and liberating, but they can also be encapsulating and
dangerous, as much for the sender as for the receiver.


HE WHO SPEAKS LITTLE IS SPONTANEOUS AND NATURAL
That is why Lao Tzu warns that _he who speaks little is
spontaneous and natural._ Every nature-born human being has
his own, fundamental astral nature. So his primary concern
should be to prevent this state of being from deteriorating or
crystallising any further than it has already. The human
tendency to chatter on meaninglessly leads not only to the
wastage of creative energy, but also to serious damage, not
only to the person concerned but also to others.
Those who speak little, because they are conscious of these
things, because they know what they are doing and are aware
of their responsibility, remain themselves and are completely
natural. Then the foundation is present for liberating self-
realisation.
So protect yourself from meaningless chatter; avoid gossip
and scandal-mongering. The so-called higher creative power is
many times more harmful than the lower creative power.
Sometimes people have the tendency make their thoughts
known to others in a very invasive way. Standing right next to
them, leaning over them, almost, they pour out their word-
streams, spewing their criticism and stirring up their listeners
with their exhaled air, infecting them with their astral state of
being. You must protect yourself from this kind of behaviour.
Imagine how it would be if some words were transmitted
to you by the Gnosis, which aroused thoughts and feelings in
you that did not correspond with your fundamental astral type
at all. In other words, suppose that, through the words spoken
in the temples of the Rosycross, forces were brought into
your respiration field which deviated totally from your
ordinary state of being. You could not avoid inhaling these
values, even though they are alien to you, because by
listening to the testimony of the Gnosis you would have
opened yourself to them.
In most cases, this would initially give rise to high winds


```
HE WHO SPEAKS LITTLE IS SPONTANEOUS AND NATURAL
```
and heavy rains, a veritable storm of conflicting
thoughts and feelings, for your inner nature would not
have been approached in harmony but in disharmony.
Your fundamental nature would be under attack, and so
it would tend to react defensively.
And now the crucial question is with what words will you
respond Will they be words of opposition, of protest, of
misconception Or will they be words of self-surrender In
the former case, the high winds and heavy rains will
intensify; in the latter


# 23 - ii

## 23— II Being one with Tao means to obtain Tao

```
From what we have said so far about chapter 23 you will
have understood some of the difficulties and tensions human
beings run into when they try to use the faculty of speech
they have been given. With the human race in its present
state, conflict situations are inevitable, not only in the
degenerating sense, but in the liberating sense as well,
because speech is a creative faculty, a creative organ.
Through this creative faculty the astral forces invoked by
your life-system and circulating in it are activated, brought
into the respiratory system, with all attendant consequences.
All who are confronted by this great problem, are being
compelled to solve it by the intercosmic radiations now inter-
penetrating the earth-field. The higher creative organ of the
human being must be freed and applied in the proper way, if
one is to avoid descending into the degeneration of the lower
passions. In the long course of humanity's development there
have always been, and there will always be, periods during
which this great requirement is set. That is why these words of
Lao Tzu are so relevant now. Every single human being is
obliged to find a solution to this great conflict.
This solution needs to begin with reticence — with
speaking little so as to be spontaneous and natural. You also
need to protect yourself from others' speech-delirium and
avoid opening yourself to speech that has no point or is
negative, for this can contaminate you with very undesirable
astral influences.
Perhaps it has occurred to you that even if you did not speak,
thoughts and feelings would still be running through
```

```
BEING ONE WITH TAO MEANS TO OBTAIN TAO
```
your mind and heart all the time. Surely is also dangerous if
thoughts, feelings and desires fall below a certain level
That is indeed the case, but by putting thoughts and
feelings into words you make them `present', and many times
more active, in the same way as something which has been
created is much more active than something which is still
only at the conceptual stage.
We have been giving you this information to help you
find a solution, but we have told you enough, now, about the
negative side of this subject and would like to return to the
positive aspects. So let us imagine, again, what happens
when, through the words of the Gnosis — which are directed
to you and to which you have opened yourself — your whole
natural system is affected via your respiration. For when this
happens, you are assailed by an astral light-power which is
not, or not yet, yours. Naturally, this causes tension in you,
for your natural astral basis exerts itself spontaneously
heavy rains fall, and high winds blow up. Unless ... unless
you become `spontaneous'!
The word-image Lao Tzu is using here is meant to convey
the idea of `not-doing', or wu wei, a concept already familiar
to you. If you are certain that the Gnosis is touching you and
disturbing your respiration-field, do not talk your tensions
out. Stop trying to explain all those inner storms and bring
yourself into a state of not-doing, by disengaging yourself
totally from any tendency to resist or struggle, and surren-
dering yourself to the Gnosis.
If you do that, if you engage fully in that, then all the
storms will cease. By entering into not-doing, into the inner
silence, into self-surrender and reticence, you will be linked
with what Lao Tzu calls `virtue', and you will be standing on
the path that leads to Tao. _Being one with Tao means to
obtain Tao. Being one with virtue means to obtain virtue._


```
BEING ONE WITH TAO MEANS TO OBTAIN TAO
```
Those who do not do this will become one with error and
will obtain error. When, following Lao Tzu, we use the word
`error', this is not meant to make you think of terrible
misdemeanours, but of the idea that every action, every
approach that leads you away from the Gnosis and maintains
you in your nature-born state, is an error.
Let us explore this idea more deeply, so that you can under-
stand it in the right way. Although there are many praise-
worthy things to be observed in pupils of the young Gnosis,
by far the majority of them have maintained their ordinary
nature-born state. In other words, they have allowed their
fundamental astral nature to remain the same. The ordinary
alternations of good and evil, positive and negative, are
clearly evident in them.
Now, however, the Gnosis is addressing them, assailing
their minds and hearts in the way described. Some sort of
conflict, whether minor or major, is then inevitable, for what
is entering their being conflicts with their fundamental astral
nature. It stabs through that nature like a sword-thrust. It does
_not_ conflict with wu wei, with being `oneself', with being
`natural' as a pupil — for in this state one is prepared. But in
those who are not prepared, there rages a storm which does
not abate.
Then these people visit each other and talk about the sub-
ject discussed in the temple, about the touch they experienced
in the temple. At this point, pandemonium can break loose.
For what are they speaking about Will they be speaking
about the new Word in them No, because it has not yet been
born. Why not Because they have maintained their
fundamental astral status, resulting from their birth in this
nature. Will the soul in them begin to speak, the new soul
No question of it. Any new soul-power in them is still con-
fined to the etheric double and cannot enter into the head


```
BEING ONE WITH TAO MEANS TO OBTAIN TAO
```
sanctuary, because it is still occupied by the old astral basis.
All kinds of misunderstandings therefore arise in the course
of the conversation. There is no evidence of the accord that
would result from understanding, on the basis of wu wei, but
instead there are many opinions, often completely at variance
with one another. So the misunderstanding is an error, a battle
of words, waged to prove someone right. But what kind of
`right' is this The `right' of the fundamental astral nature of one
of the participants, often accompanied by an unhealthy tenacity
and stubbornness. That, too, is an error!
If there were nothing more to it than that, the only result of
the error would be a distinct lack of fruitfulness. But all that
debate and argument actually amounts to a creative orgy, to
one great, formidable impurity. For the raucous clamouring of
the participants has made all kinds of dialectical astral forces
`present', and this whole plethora of astral influences is intro-
duced into their respiration fields. The participants have
assaulted each other. They have committed a moral error of
the first order, and everything the Gnosis wanted to convey to
them would have withdrawn straight away, right at the outset
of the conversation. So not only has the touch been rendered
useless, but it has also been turned into the cause of an
intense moral deterioration. Therefore, let it penetrate into
your consciousness that _He who conforms to error, will
become one with error._
You must understand that there are various forms and aspects
of moral deterioration. The kind discussed here is the most
serious. Every quarrel is an error and an affront to the
personalities of all parties involved. Please realise, also, that the
results of such an error are not confined to those directly
concerned. The astral results of such quarrels contaminate the
entire life-sphere of humankind. It is one great immorality! So
is it not alarming that a gnostic Spiritual School, by doing


```
BEING ONE WITH TAO MEANS TO OBTAIN TAO
```
its work for the whole of humankind, can be the cause of
such a thing
How does this come about Through lack of faith and
trust, and its consequences, as a result of which the
fundamental astral state is maintained. _Not having sufficient
faith,_ says Lao Tzu, _means to have no faith at all._


# 23 - iii

# Not having sufficient faith

## 23— III Not having sufficient faith means to have no faith at all

```
We have explained at some length how much every human
being is dependent on and controlled by his or her astral state of
being. If the fundamental astral state resulting from one's birth
in nature cannot be sufficiently altered, if one's astral
imprisonment cannot be ended, one cannot hope for even one
moment to experience pupilship in a liberating way.
The task is this to become one with Tao, to become one
with virtue. The power with which this oneness is attained is
the power of faith. With a strong faith in the reality and truth
of the Gnosis, and an intense yearning to participate in that
high reality, one will be able to break through any obstacle
that might exist between oneself and one's goal. Faith
conquers everything! That is why the wondrous faculty of
faith needs to be fully developed, if it is to achieve results.
So Lao Tzu's saying, that not having sufficient faith means to
have no faith at all, leaves nothing to be desired as far as
clarity is concerned.
It is a good idea to begin by asking oneself whereabouts in
the body the faculty of faith is seated. Is it connected with any
organ Or is it an organ
If you begin to investigate these things, you will discover
that faith is not only an emotional state, but equally involves
the mind, and especially the will. Originating in the heart
and in the head, faith spreads throughout the whole being.
We are irradiated by it, so that straight away we are affected
by it not only physically, but also psychologically. The
physical state of faith is evidence that the blood, the nerve-
fluid and the endocrine system are under the influence of
```

```
NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT FAITH MEANS TO HAVE NO FAITH AT ALL
```
the faith-vibration. If they were not, there would be no question
of all-fulfilling faith.
This activity, which is sometimes so very powerful, must
clearly be supported by the etheric double, which in turn
must be supported by the astral body. The seven chakras of
the astral body must have opened for the light of the Gnosis,
with all the attendant consequences. It is also important to
understand the great difference between positive faith and its
power, and faith in its negative form.
The power of faith in the positive sense develops through
two astral elements, that of the chakra respiration and that of
the ordinary respiration. The first takes following route
chakras — etheric body — material body. The second route is
as follows the personal respiration-field — the head sanctuary
— the breath — speech. When these two astral, influences and
processes meet and converge, in such a way that what is
within corresponds completely to what is without, we can
speak of a positive state of faith. It is clear, we hope, that such
a positive state of faith can only come into being through
walking the path, in total self-surrender.
So now let us contrast this with faith in its negative form.
For karmic reasons, or because of hereditary influences, or
because much sorrow has driven him to it, a person might
become interested in a particular religious orientation. If this
interest is to deliver a positive result, then the orientation
needs to be combined with a liberating way of life. If this
approach to life is not present, the seven chakras of the
astral body will not be affected and the astral influence
resulting from the person's faith will only affect him via his
respiration-field, his brain and his speech. Part of his
personality-system will thus be touched by a new influence,
while the other part, the greater part, will remain totally
unaffected.


```
NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT FAITH MEANS TO HAVE NO FAITH AT ALL
```
Naturally, this is bound to give rise to all kinds of un-
desirable conditions. By using this one-sided method of
exerting astral influence, religious revival preachers can
goad great masses of people into a partial, and thus a nega-
tive faith-ecstasy. But it is a straw fire, which rapidly burns
out and often leaves behind unpleasant traces.
So now we have seen the difference between positive faith
and negative faith, and we are ready to ask what faith is capable
of.
Let us take as an example a person who genuinely begins to
yearn for the living salvation contained in the Gnosis. This
yearning, born in the heart, will manifest its influence in the
head so that, alongside the yearning, understanding will arise,
and this will lead to an activation of the will. The person will
understand that, if his yearning is to result in attainment, pos-
session, a new life of action will be necessary, an approach to
life which is at one with `virtue' and completely disengaged
from error.
If the person takes this course of action, a remarkable
transformation will occur in him, as the precursor of trans-
figuration. His chakras will begin to rotate in the opposite
direction to the one characteristic of this nature. Soul-power
will accumulate in the etheric body. The four holy foods will
circulate throughout the whole of the material system.
After this process of preparation, the moment will come
when the real, all-conquering faith is born. It will announce
itself as a mighty surge of power throughout the whole being.
One's whole being will be filled with the true power of faith.
The Bible says of this power `If your faith were as small as a
grain of mustard seed, you would be able to move mountains.'
And `faith is the foundation of things not seen.'
All this has to do with a new astral power, the light-power of
the Gnosis, which can, if one has been prepared and trained


```
NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT FAITH MEANS TO HAVE NO FAITH AT
ALL
```
in the right way, be applied magically for the salvation of
humankind. This magical power is applied with the higher
creative organ. The living word is spoken, in the same way
as when Jesus the Lord uttered the words `I will, be clean.'
That is how you can know and experience what faith, as
Lao Tzu understood it, can do.


_Standing on tiptoe, one cannot remain upright. Taking strides
which are too large, one cannot walk._

_He who wishes to radiate light is not enlightened. He who
wishes to be the true human being will not surpass others.
Boasting, he gains no merit. Reaching for the top, he is not
superior._

_Compared to Tao, this behaviour is like left-over food or other
decaying remnants, which are always abhorred._

_That is why those who live in Tao do not concern themselves
with it._

Tao Te Ching 24

# 24 - i

# Selfishness

The meaning of chapter 24 of the Tao Te Ching is very clear.
In a few simple lines, Lao Tzu sketches the habits of the
ordinary, nature-born human being. He does it in a way that is
so striking, so relevant to us now, that we are left wondering
what should astonish us the most the fact that Lao Tzu was
able, thousands of years ago, to typify so accurately the twen-
tieth century human being, or the fact that throughout all
those thousands of years nothing about the nature-born
human being seems to have changed.
But your astonishment will rapidly fade if you are willing
to realise that, in fact, the psychological disposition of the
nature-born human being is not susceptible to change. Exter-
nal conditions may alter, but nature-born human beings
remain inescapably true to their nature, which is essentially
selfish. Selfishness, in its various gradations, is the primal
urge of nature. It is not possible for human beings to free
themselves from it unless they give up the self completely.
The deepest and most crystallised form of selfishness is that
of the rock-hard, I-central human being who, from the cradle
to the grave, is totally absorbed in his own self and his own
interests. Such a person does not maintain a single emotional
tie; no family ties — such as a bond with his mother, marriage
partner or child — affect him. This form of selfishness, which
shuts out everyone and everything, is below even the animal
level, for even in the animal kingdom ties of love are formed,
albeit temporarily, between the mother animal and her young,
and the mother may often perform acts of self-sacrifice in
order to protect her offspring.


SELFISHNESS
That is why, nowadays, people who show this form of
selfishness — giving themselves up completely to their sub-
animal lusts and desires — are regarded as being mentally
disturbed.
Yet, in all countries, there is now a rapid increase in this type
of selfishness. This is proof that humanity is fast descending
below the level of what can still be called human, and it is a
clear indication of the approaching end-phase.
A higher form of selfishness is the kind which includes the
family, although the self remains the central factor. In this
group, for a shorter or longer period of time, blood-ties speak
a clear language. This language is easy to explain, because
caring for members of one's family, and doing things for
them, is obviously self-actualising and self-reinforcing in the
natural sense, and therefore has the effect of considerably
expanding the self. It is a kind of selfishness in which all the
highly prized virtues of fatherhood and motherhood are
expressed.
Familial selfishness has been subjected to various forms of
cultural conditioning and is regulated and supported by many
laws. The fact that it _is_ a form of selfishness is evident from the
joys and exertions, the eulogies and pride people show when
their family members achieve success in life, even if this
success is not always gained on a proper moral basis.
When two families squabble because they both want the
same thing, the fact that selfishness is at the root of family ties
becomes even more clearly evident. The two families may be
quite good, individually, but nevertheless a fierce conflict
develops between them, and it is conflict with the same astral
foundations, fed by the same astral forces that once roused the
primitive cave-dweller to action. The forms of the conflict may
differ, but the essence and the results always remain the same
combat and defeat.


```
SELFISHNESS
```
Selfishness can also expand to include a whole group,
nation or race. We know the results of this kind of selfishness
only too well. If an individual is infected by the selfishness-
psychosis of a group or nation, it is certain that the other
forms of selfishness will not be far away. On the contrary,
they can be aroused by it, for the interests of the individual
human being can very easily be threatened by those of the
group. The forces of selfishness in the individual are then put
under much greater pressure, and the result is inevitable an
outbreak of conflict!
However, if we are to understand properly what Lao Tzu
means, we should not forget that when selfishness develops in
the upward sense, this is always accompanied by a moral
development. Countless are the examples of human beings who
sacrifice their own interests for those of their family, group,
country, or nation, or, to a lesser extent, their race. World-
literature is full of such heroic tales. Perhaps it is necessary to
take many of them with a pinch of salt, because the readiness to
make sacrifices is so often interwoven with some form of
selfishness. But nevertheless the fact remains that the higher
forms of selfishness _can_ go hand in hand with moral
development, stimulated by religion and humanism and
supported by legislation.
So now humanity is at last approaching the highest rung on
the ladder of selfishness-culture, which is naturally highly
camouflaged by various forms of morality. After having
reached that highest rung, naturally whilst retaining all the
lower rungs, because that's how ladders work, human beings
will discover that there is no higher rung. This will signal the
end of the whole Aryan era, just as we have now come to the
end of a _phase_ in that Aryan era. This highest rung of the ladder
has to do with the merging, the integration, the unification of
the whole human race. First it is the individual, then


```
SELFISHNESS
```
the family, then the tribe or nation, then the race, and finally the
whole of humanity. In every era, and in every phase within an
era, this entire course of development is followed to the end.
The final phase is when all distinctions between nations,
communities of nations and races are removed.
Signs of this approaching world-revolution are already
clearly evident. People are clamouring more and more loudly
for total integration. All over the world, church members are
campaigning for the removal of religious differences.
Political power blocs have already been formed and we can
clearly distinguish two great groups, two interest groups into
which humanity is split the Eastern bloc and the Western
bloc. Both groups know that, if they keep on maintaining
their own selfish standpoints, the whole human race will be
annihilated. Meanwhile, it is becoming clear to everyone that
gone for good are the times when there could be a front line
where the dead and wounded fell, with the staff quarters for
the war directors safely behind it, and an even more heavily
protected nest for the various governments and leading
economic groups still further away. Furthermore, modern
technological equipment has eliminated the possibility of one
side being able to annihilate the other by surprise. So, since
the fundamental principle of selfishness is self-protection,
both sides will be obliged to unite.
It is possible and even probable that, before people recognise
this obligation as inescapable right across the board, a good
deal of conflict will still occur, but the progress of the culture
of the last phase can no longer be held back.
A large group of authorities is deeply convinced of the need
for a new order of things to be established in our times. Also,
there is actually a daily, unbroken contact between the top
groups from the two camps, both political and religious,


```
SELFISHNESS
```
even though most of these exchanges are not publicised in
the world press.
Their question is not `Shall we do it', but `How shall we
do it How shall we get the people — the masses — on our
side and justify this enormous about-face of all the values we
formerly taught them to regard as sacrosanct'
But essentially, there is no choice, because the whole
human race is standing with its back to the wall. At first
people imagined that the effects of exploding a nuclear bomb
could be confined to the enemy, but now they realise the full
extent of the risk, and that is why the whole choir will soon
_have_ to sing `All men will become brothers'. Many churches
and religious movements, too, are seeking enforced unifi-
cation.
Why is all this happening Because the culture of selfish-
ness, the struggle for existence, the fear of death and destruc-
tion, are driving humanity towards this final step. Forced
unification or mutual destruction humanity will have to
choose between these two extremes!
Driven by need and the fear of death, humanity is choosing
the former alternative. When it is attained, the limit of human
selfishness-culture will have been reached. But bear in mind
that the other, lower aspects of selfishness will still go on
existing, for they are ineradicable.
So the great unity of nations and races will only be able to
be maintained through the use of force, with the cooperation
and guidance of all the authorities. The world-government of
the end-phase will therefore be fascist, and all people will be
forced to become `brothers' the final clause in the law of
self-maintenance.
Meanwhile everyone is standing on tiptoe, stretching and
straining as much as they can, so as to grab as much plunder


```
SELFISHNESS
```
as possible. They are trying to take huge strides, so as to reach
their goals as quickly as possible. In the beginning the churches
will, in their delusion, speak about nothing else than the light
that will now be able to shine throughout the world, the light
that is the will of Christ.
But the fierce battle to become or to seem the greatest and
the best will go on. In their monster corporations, the practi-
tioners of selfishness will now exploit humanity wholesale.
Anyone who observes this race to the abyss with any
measure of soul-quality, and hence objectively, will feel
nauseous at the sight of such great deception. _Compared to
Tao,_ this behaviour is _like left-over food or other decaying
remnants, which are always abhorred._
Do you intend to take part in this deception Or will you —
seeking the way of Tao — choose the other path



# 24 - ii

## 24— II The walls of Jericho

```
In our initial discussion of chapter 24 of Lao Tzu's Tao Te
Ching we showed you where human selfishness will ultimately
lead. One may complain about it, particularly if one has to
taste defeat in the struggle for existence or in a conflict of
interests, but the fact remains that selfishness and hence I-
centrality are essential characteristics of the nature-born
human being. Wherever life awakens in the nature of death, it
is always surrounded by danger, and in this way selfishness,
the survival instinct, automatically emerges. As creatures of
this nature, all human beings, without exception, are selfish.
As you read this you are probably being stirred by a range of
feelings and thoughts, because you do not find it pleasant to be
called selfish. You feel rather insulted. Unless you belong to
that large group of people who are so deeply absorbed in their
nature-born state that they find the essential characteristics of
human nature completely natural, you are bound to feel
somewhat stung when you hear these sober facts about
selfishness.
That, in itself, is remarkable, for a reaction like that is not
characteristic of the ordinary human instincts. We are not talk-
ing about the resentment some people feel as the result of some
past defeat in the business of selfishness, but the feeling of dis-
appointment, the feeling of being unmasked, of being thrown
off a pedestal. One of the causes of that pain is your knowledge
of the Bible and the Universal Doctrine, which clearly show
selfishness as the source of unholiness. Another cause is the
voice of the rose in you, the voice of your conscience, which
constantly appeals to you on account of your behaviour.
```

THE WALLS OF JERICHO
The result is that a constant flow of thoughts surges through
you `I really should do this differently. I should do this better.
And that must disappear, as soon as possible.' In this way, an
inner conflict develops between your moral aspirations and your
selfish behaviour. You will certainly have come across a whole
range of moralists who, from mystical, humane and other
angles, encourage you to continue with this inner struggle.
However, the struggle is hopeless, for human nature cannot be
changed in any fundamental way. It is impossible. Whenever, as
is so often the case, you experience the conflict between
morality and selfishness, you try to settle it in favour of moral-
ity. But you will find that you always suffer defeat, and you
remain the same as before.
You possess a relatively high morality. This is something that
can be learned; driven by necessity and suffering, one can
train oneself to act in amoral way, just as one can learn the habits
of civilisation. One can learn to act as if one is radiating light;
one can learn to be pleasant, and to appear mystical. This is not a
question of hypocrisy, but as personality-beings we are capable
of imagining how a gnostic, a reborn soul-being, might behave.
In this way we learn how to seem pleasant and acceptable, and
we learn to put on mystical airs.
But selfishness cannot be destroyed. It is an integral part of
human nature. It was Lao Tzu's aim in chapter 24 to make this
clear to his pupils. You, too, are trying to use your moral aspi-
rations not only to keep yourself under control but also to live
your pupilship.
You poor thing! Don't you know that your efforts to impose
moral behaviour on yourself are serving no other purpose than
the defence of a certain aspect of selfishness This is your line of
reasoning `It would really be wonderful if I could be a good
pupil; if I were to possess the new soul-state; if I were to comply
with the requirements of pupilship; if I were to attain this or that


```
THE WALLS OF JERICHO
```
in the sense of the Gnosis' — and so on. Mostly, you replace the
word `I' with `we', because it sounds better. But `we', or in other
words `I', do not have any success, because everything `I' want
and desire is nothing else than an effort to lodge the I safely in a
particular aspect of selfishness.
This urge for self-preservation fills your whole being. It
makes you exert yourself to the utmost. You stand on tiptoe and
stretch upwards as far you can, in order to grasp what you
desire. But you can't keep it up. You can't remain upright. You
try bring some speed into your life and you try, as far as
possible and as far as your legs can stretch, to drive yourself in
the desired direction. But to no avail!
After numerous failures, you begin to take it easy. For you
soon realise that the others have not succeeded with their
moral re-armament either. Then the I starts to put on an act.
It talks about light, and `radiates' so-called light, and what
then emerges is an astral state which has nothing to do with
light. But it is one of your range of moral armaments, and
you placate yourself with it. You become very busy; you
undertake all kinds of activities for the School of the
Rosycross and its work and you manifest your personality in
what you do. You try to personify the true human being, but
without success. You talk a great deal about your dedication,
but it does not have the desired results. Straining yourself,
you leap as high as you can, but you land on the hard ground
of your state of being. Whatever you do, the end is negative.
You are not a hypocrite —you are only playing the game of
moral re-armament. But the armaments turn out to consist of
nothing but gilded cardboard and delusion.
So we are obliged to draw this conclusion _Compared to
Tao, this behaviour is like left-over food or other decaying
remnants, which are always abhorred._
Anyone who attempts self-realisation in the way described,


```
THE WALLS OF JERICHO
```
will end up following the course of development described in
the previous chapter the course of primitive individualism,
which terminates in a state of enforced unification.
Consider the reality of our young gnostic Brotherhood.
Our pupils unmistakably form a group. They are all familiar
to some extent with group unity. But do they really form a
community of the genuine, living soul-state Have they
transcended their natural state of being, and thus their funda-
mental, animal selfishness
If the answer to these questions is no, is it not the case,
then, that the group's existence is being maintained by means
of moral re-armament Constantly repeated agreements,
constantly renewed reflection, constant corrective measures
— and time and time again the disillusioning discovery that
selfishness has not disappeared. People wound each other
with their personal tendencies, with their behaviour, and it
causes much suffering.
So in deepest essence, your life has not become any easier.
With your pronounced individualism you have undertaken a
certain course which has brought you, now, into a community.
And because your selfishness has not disappeared you have
submitted yourself to a law numerous rules regulate life in
society. All that has ever been, comes back in some other form.
The sun rises and the sun sets, and everything remains the same.
Everyone is overcome with weariness.
So the destination of humanity as a whole has already been
reached by our group community of individualists. They have
reached the limits of their development. It is not possible to
possess more morality than you do. You have made the very
most of your possibilities, and now you stand at the border. So
the School now faces either the end of its existence — for what
more can its pupils do — or the breakthrough!
If any individual or group wants to transcend selfish-


```
THE WALLS OF JERICHO
```
ness, the ordinary path of moral development must first be
followed as quickly as possible until the lawful end is reached,
the limit of what it is humanly possible to attain. The whole
arsenal of moral armaments will have to be exhausted before it
will be possible to cross the border. But still, because of the
suction power of selfishness and self-maintenance, the group
keeps on being drawn back into the desert.
When one's efforts to behave morally bring so much sorrow
and defeat, one is inclined to wonder whether, in fact, it is
useless or even wrong to try to maintain high moral standards in
the group.
But no, for ultimately all these efforts and failures make the
individual and the group susceptible to self-surrender. In other
words, you become willing to give up every selfish urge
— for instance, the urge to impose your point of view on others
— in the service of the one life which is of the soul, and which
will lead to the true, promised land. Only the person who lives
in Tao will transcend selfishness.
The soul-quality which is accumulating in your etheric body
because of your participation in the Spiritual School, must be
able to manifest itself; it must be able to develop into the Other
One. Therefore, in order to awaken the Other One, who is
dormant in you, you need to silence the old human being,
consistently, day and night; you need to subordinate and give up
every urge of nature, in the service of the Other One growing in
you. Only the person who lives in Tao will transcend
selfishness. The soul which must take shape and grow in the
etheric body, has to follow entirely different norms of life. The
life-field of the soul is quite different from the dense earthly
sphere. If you want to leave the desert in which you are
wandering, this is the only way to practise self-surrender,
consciously, right down to the smallest details, always regarding
others as more excellent than your-


```
THE WALLS OF JERICHO
```
self and applying the highest standards of morality.
This means subordinating all desires — yours and those of
your friends and relations — to the laws of Tao, to the norms
of the School and the Work. That alone is the practise, the
essence, of the law of love. `Love God above everything, and
your neighbour as yourself.' If you subordinate yourself to the
laws of Tao, you will, in your interaction with your neigh-
bours, your fellow human beings, test, help and spur them
onward with the one law of divine love.
Once this approach to life has been established absolutely
in you, the soul will be born and, step by step, the Seven-
Spirit will enter into connection with it. In that process — if
you can understand the symbolism — you will march seven
times around the place called Jericho. It is the beloved place
known to us as `the new life-field'. At last, after the seventh
time, the walls that separate you from the essence of renewal
will collapse, and you will be free.
So we have seen how your course through life oscillates
between the two poles of selfishness and morality. They are
in conflict with each other, they try to eradicate each other,
but without success. If things take a negative turn, selfishness
can completely win the struggle. The individual then becomes
sub-animal. If the development is positive, the person will be
driven to a border. If he cannot cross that border, he will
remain, as the ancient legends say, wandering in the desert
for forty years (because forty is the number of completion).
In other words, he will remain locked in the struggle between
selfishness and morality.
Selfishness is like a snake which keeps on menacing and
stinging you. Morality tries to make you immune to this danger.
It is the consuming fire in which the nature-born person burns. It
is the hell you make for yourself, and it includes the highest
possible state of morality. 270


THE WALLS OF JERICHO
The whole group of the young Gnosis now stands before
that border, thanks be to God! That is why they are feeling the
fierce pain of despair, thanks be to God! That is why there is
that scorching fire, thanks be to God! That is why there is the
despairing cry `What more, in God's name, can we do'
Whoever has reached the stage at which this cry of the heart
can be uttered, can understand what has to be understood,
thanks be to God!
For there is an entirely different state of life. There is ano-
ther morality, which one neither may nor can call `morality'
any longer. We call it self-surrender. That means subordina-
ting your entire life, all your personal interests, everything that
typifies selfishness, in the most individual as well as in the
broadest sense, in personal as well as in impersonal things, to
the life in Tao, to the essence of Tao. It means subordinating
your whole being to the School and the Gnosis. It means
being, like the young Jesus, immersed completely in the things
of the Father. It means saying, if necessary, to your natural,
selfish urges what Jesus the Lord said to his mother `Woman,
what have you to do with me Must I not be about my Father's
business' That is the life in Tao. That is how one gains
participation in divine love. That is how to liberate the soul.
That is how the walls of Jericho are sent tumbling down.
As a School, as a group, we are standing before the walls.
Let us not sink down in anguish and despair at our lack of
understanding, and let us not reproach each other on account
of our natural state of selfishness, but rather, let us rejoice and
march seven times around the walls.


### 24 - iii

### Devotion to Tao

To conclude our discussion of chapter 24 it would perhaps be
useful to remind you of a fact very much emphasised by the
Universal Doctrine; the fact that, as long as the personal ego, or
self-seeking as a state of consciousness, is not completely and
utterly devoted to what we call the soul, there neither can nor
will be any question of a new state of life.
But this does not mean one should begin with the complete
destruction of the personal ego. Because as long as the soul,
which is the instrument of the higher consciousness, is not yet
growing in you, you still need the instrument of the lower
consciousness in order to keep your personality-vehicles
together as a threefold unit. Furthermore, the I-central state,
through its self-sacrifice, is needed to lead the personality
through the hours of night until the moment of dawn, when the
soul-being will be able to take over the guidance of the
personality-system.
So the I-being, the self-seeking human being, has a task.
This is something we want you to realise very clearly indeed,
and it explains why the holy legends dealing with the lower,
earthly self's pilgrimage say that the traveller will never be able
to reach the goal on the other shore.
If you were to realise that, the problems now troubling you
would take on quite another aspect. The nature-born human
being, the self-seeking human being, has a task to perform.
There is a goal underlying his existence. Being a self-seeking
individual does not mean he is evil, or a sinner, or an abnor-
mality in the All-Manifestation. But in his present state, and in
the life-field in which he lives, his consciousness and his


```
DEVOTION TO TAO
```
nature must be applied in order to set free the Other One, the
soul-being. He will only be a sinner, an abnormal, evil creation
if he does not fulfil that one task which underlies his whole
existence.
All these ideas are contained in the familiar story of the
double figure John-Jesus John, who performs his work of self-
surrender; Jesus, the soul-being, who is freed and baptised by
John. Jesus the Lord calls John the greatest of earth-born human
beings, for it is John who makes possible the birth of the true
human being, the soul-being.
Perhaps you will now understand how important it is
that, as a nature-born human being, you not only realise
your limitations and your earthly possibilities, but at the
same time discover your task and make it the governing
factor in your life. That is why we keep on telling you
about the new approach to life, about the way of life that
needs to be adopted by those who are willing to fulfil the
task they have been called to by God. If that is what you
want, if you walk that path, then, and only then, will the
Christ be manifested in you.
You may often have heard the expression, `Christ takes all
our sins upon himself', and the biblical saying, `Though your
sins be red as scarlet, I shall wash them whiter than snow.'
But you need to realise the full significance of these words.
The Christ is the soul with which the Seven-Spirit has been
linked. If, in obedience to the call, you follow the path of the
endura, the path of self-surrender, and the soul really comes
to life in you, then this living soul will draw up everything
that lies enclosed within your microcosm into the new life-
field and impart to this whole being the signature of the new
life-state. In other words, the divine Son will be manifested
in you as the saviour, the sublime Redeemer. He will take all
your sins upon himself.


DEVOTION TO TAO
How must this path be walked The method has already
been shown to you many, many times. The key is devotion to
Tao. You need to completely reorientate your path through
life; you need to `turn around', just as Christian Rosycross
did on the evening before Easter. This `turning around'
means consciously surrendering your whole nature-born
personality, which means giving up all self-seeking, all self-
serving. These things are the cause of all sin and human
suffering, and you will have to reject them, clearly and
consciously. From that moment on, you will have to serve
and obey Tao, which is transpersonal love.
The nature-born person of the present era is a very crystal-
lised being as far as his personality-vehicles are concerned.
His nature, his consciousness and his organs are entirely at-
tuned to the life-sphere in which he exists. The soul cannot
live in that life-sphere. At most, the soul can call him, and
stimulate him to seek and approach the kingdom of the soul.
For the kingdom of the soul-prince is not of this world.
If the personality hears and obeys that voice, he will still
need his own consciousness, the form of consciousness adapted
to his needs, in order to carry out the initial work of making the
paths straight, until the border, the limit is reached — the bank
of the River Jordan. Then, and only then, will the Other One
take over the work, and lead him on paths where he as a
personality-being cannot go. The Other One in him will lead
his whole being from glory to glory.
The primordial human being has always known of this
mighty process of salvation, but he has been imprisoned in
forgetfulness. Nevertheless, in the mysteries, the noble
science of liberation has always been preserved. Just as a
deep-sea diver needs special equipment to keep him alive
when he goes down into the depths of the sea, so the human
being who sinks into the nadir of materiality needs a special


```
DEVOTION TO TAO
```
state of consciousness. If that person wishes to rise out of the
nadir, he will need to lay aside the state of life belonging to the
nadir; he will need to give it up. This means that, at a given
moment, an entirely different, new state of consciousness will
have to take the place of the former one, the state of
consciousness of the living soul `He who is willing to lose his
life for my sake,' says Jesus the Lord, `will find `It', Tao.'
If you regard all this as nothing more than a moral status, a
new addition to your present range of armaments, then the
nadir, the border, will not let you go. Whereas if, from this
moment on, you enter into the new approach to life, which
runs entirely contrary to the nature of self-seeking, then this
will put an end to your natural state and at the same time set
you completely free.

```
Being. Thus begins chapter 25 of the Tao Te Ching. These
words are an indication that this chapter's aim is to give
information about the two aspects of genesis cosmos and
anthropos, the world and the human being. Our attention is
especially drawn to the fact that before heaven and earth
existed there was `something else'. This point is forgotten by
most students of metaphysics, the science of the super-
sensory. That is a pity, because without sound knowledge of
this fact, errors are bound to be made.
If you want to understand this first verse of chapter 25, you
will need to realise that, ever since the beginning, there have
been two astral fields, two universes. As members of the
young Gnosis we are quite used to this idea, because we are
constantly explaining about the nature of death and the nature
of life, about the dialectical nature and the original nature.
This concept is not purely philosophical, but can be
scientifically demonstrated.
On it rests the entire gnostic revelation of salvation the
awareness that a path exists, leading from the dialectical
nature to the original nature. Throughout all times, gnostic
philosophy has always spoken about these two natures.
Gnostics have always spoken of the realms of life and the
realms of liberation.
Note that subtle distinction, which is so easily missed. There
is a great difference between the waters of life and the living
water. The living water, says the Universal Doctrine, serves for
the liberation of those who are on or in the waters of
```

```
RELIGION AND THEOLOGY
```
life. This situation differs from the one that prevailed in for-
mer times, when there was close harmony between the living
water and the waters of life. This was before the Fall, when
the waters of life had not yet become evil but were only of a
field of development, in equilibrium with the one, divine
nature. At that time, then, the function of the living water was
to create. Now, however, its function is to re-create. So there
are two mighty astral fields, one of which is constantly trying
to restore order in the other.
The age-old doctrine of the two natures is also recorded in
the Bible. The words, `In the beginning God created heaven
and earth', for instance, refer to this idea. You will see what
we mean when you realise that the original scriptures did not
use the term `God', but usually a plural form such as _Sephi-
roth,_ or _Elohim._ These names refer to lifewaves far above
ours, which are sometimes known as the absolutely pure ones,
the perfect ones, or the divine ones.
Theologians of various religious persuasions deliberately
omitted these names, because their theology was just
intellectual knowledge, and not founded on universal
wisdom. They wanted to avoid the risk of being asked by
their followers, who regarded them as all-knowing, to
explain just exactly who the Sephiroth and the Elohim are.
They would have been unable to answer that question
without consulting gnostic philosophers, who never shied
away from the truth because they possessed it and could
understand it. But the theologians would rather have died
than let anyone see they were inferior to those they had
denied, persecuted and handed over to the executioner.
Moreover, they would then have lost all their followers. That
is why they hid behind the abstract term, `God'.
In the prologue of the gospel according to John, too, the
doctrine of the two fields is mentioned. Here they are referred


```
RELIGION AND THEOLOGY
```
to as `the Word' and `the darkness'. Because the darkness does
not comprehend the Word, the messengers of the Word come to
the darkness. But time and time again, in every era, these
messengers of the light and their servants are persecuted by
theologians. And whether one calls them theologians, scribes or
pharisees, the facts remain the same. Jesus the Lord was
persecuted and killed by the church of his day, in cooperation
with the government. As long as the dialectical world, the
nature of death, continues to exist, there will be no change in
this pattern of events.
So the great disaster which has been spreading insidiously
throughout our field of life since the beginning of our era was
not caused by what is generally thought of as `religion', but
only by what people presume to call `learning'. Theology is a
system of learning which is based on the collection of intel-
lectual facts. Theology is the product of a purely intellectual
activity. That is why it is bound to lead to disaster, like every
other system of learning, unless it is based on the universal
philosophy of salvation and emanates from the fount of living
water. Every system of learning not derived from that source
has always led to disaster throughout history.
It would be really useful if you were more clearly aware of
exactly what has to happen in you if you are to fulfil your
task in life. The primary requirement is for the heart to begin
to speak, in the midst of the degeneration of life. The heart
must be filled with yearning for a solution to the afflictions
and problems which are overwhelming the world and human-
kind to an ever increasing extent. The yearning of the heart
and its longing for wisdom are always the womb of genuine
religion and learning. If you experience this state of being,
this oppression of the heart, this yearning of the heart for a
solution to the afflictions of life, then the urge towards wis-
dom is bound to be born in you.


RELIGION AND THEOLOGY
What is the world, and what is humanity What is
humanity's task, and what path should it follow
Through the urging of the heart, the intellectual organs are
set in motion. The thinking processes begin to support the
heart's desire. The mind seeks, it looks in every direction for a
solution. In this way, at first, a speculative philosophy is
born. The mouth speaks and testifies of the heart's yearning
and of the mind's considerations and seeking, and of every-
thing that has been discovered and encountered. A whole path
of experience is the result of this.
In this way the individual follows a path through the anti-
theses of the nature of death and eventually discovers that
everything comes and goes, and there is no real progress. This
discovery stimulates both the yearning — as an activity of the
heart — and the mental seeking — as an activity of the head.
The individual intensifies his efforts to seek and to try to
serve humanity.
And then, at last, all this speculation comes to an end, for
the light of the other realm breaks in. The Word cleaves
through the darkness and the philosophy of speculative
thinking can be replaced, through the action of grace and
truth, by the great reality itself, by the one, absolute power
and wisdom which is of Tao.
Only from this wisdom, from this Universal Doctrine as a
first-hand possession, can the kind of religion and learning be
born that will bring humanity genuine happiness, peace, love
and joy. That is why it is said that only love can set you free,
and that God is love. That is why you are told to `love God
above all and your neighbour as yourself.'
The word `love' needs to be understood in the right way.
There are many things in this world which arouse your love
things like family, material things, country, nation, race,
friends, life itself, and because of your natural, human


```
RELIGION AND THEOLOGY
```
goodness there are many people and things you hold in your
embrace — including, possibly, the School of the Rosycross.
Yet this kind of love is only an aspect of the initial phase of
the inescapable process — the phase of yearning and specula-
tive thinking — until the living truth itself is born in you. Then
the Godhead, who is love itself, will have entered into you as a
first-hand possession. Then you yourself will have become
love, just as God is love.
Love God above all things. This expression is often mis-
used by interpreting it in a purely mystical sense. But we do
not want you to see it in that way at all. What we mean is that,
once you have found God in the way we have described, on
the path that leads to the development of gnostic conscious-
ness, you can, for the first time, love God truly. And if, in this
way, you have approached God in truth and reality, you will
also be able to approach your neighbours with the power you
possess. You will be able to love your neighbour as yourself.
Then you will only be able to do two things, which will
become, for you, an unbreakable, unassailable approach to life
you will serve and love the Godhead, the Being that is above
and beyond heaven and earth, the essential Reality of the other
realm. And because you have become one with that Being you
will also be able to serve and love your neighbours. You will
not be able to do otherwise. There is only one way in which
you will be able to do it by showing your neighbours the
requirements of the path, and offering them the power to fulfil
those requirements.
Imagine that your whole state of being had become light.
Would you approach your neighbours with darkness Would
you be able to sit by while your neighbour served the darkness
What you were, you would manifest in and for others. So that
light is the only thing you would be able to give your
neighbours, and you would give it in order to manifest to them


```
RELIGION AND THEOLOGY
```
the power that makes it possible to fulfil the one requirement.
If they were neither willing nor able to comply with this
requirement of love, then you would love them in such a way
that you would be able to set them free, to leave them their
freedom. For you would know that as long as a person is not of
the Gnosis, or cannot yet be, he cannot enter the other realm.
So to hold on to him would mean to burn him. And that would
not be love at all.
That is why neighbourly love, which belongs to reality
itself, is always prepared to wait. It will wait as long as it
takes for there to be equilibrium between the two natures the
one nature, which is of God, and the other nature, the field of
development. As soon as there is equilibrium between these
two fields, between these two natures, they will flow together
into one. If you can understand these things, then we are ready
to begin our analysis of chapter 25.



# 25 - II

# Before heaven and earth existed,

# there was an indefinite Being

There are, as we said, two natures. We call them the nature
of life and the nature of death, the dialectical nature and the
divine nature. In the dialectical nature the alternation of
opposites prevails. Because people do not understand how
this alternation works, it causes them much sorrow and
misery, particularly when they cling to one of its aspects and
try to make it lasting.
The dialectical nature is meant to be the training school of
eternity. That is why it is necessary for things to keep on
changing, coming and going, and for opposite aspects to
keep on alternating with each other. This explains why,
throughout the nature of death, we see changes occurring not
only in the various aspects of human society — changes
which are caused by rotation and interchange of radiations —
but also in the fundamental structure of things.
In this way, from time to time, the structure of our planet
changes. Continents sink and others rise up from the depths
of the ocean. Through the precession of the equinoxes,
climates change because of the displacement of the poles.
But there are also times when the entire planet dies and
dissolves. So the entire solar system is a life-form which is
subject to successive incarnations. Therefore, it is not only
the human personality that passes away and evaporates, but
also the whole planetary manifestation. The life of the sun,
too, is subject to ending and revivification.
What we want you to do, now, is to make this image as
vivid as possible in your inner being. Impress upon yourself
the fact that, before your personality existed, something else


BEFORE HEAVEN AND EARTH EXISTED, THERE WAS AN INDEFINITE BEING

was, namely your microcosm or monad. Before you existed
there was an indefinite, non-material being, whose life-state,
compared to yours, was peaceful and calm. What a differ-
ence! You a creature of turmoil. Your monad originating
from and existing in that entirely Other Life. This same rela-
tionship exists with respect to the earth. Before the earth
existed, too, there was an indefinite, non-material being. The
earth contorts from time to time because of the turmoil which
afflicts her and which forces its way upwards from her
interior. But the other earth, the one John once saw
descending, is completely non-material. So there is a dis-
tinction between the Planetary Spirit, which is a material
manifestation, and its monadic counterpart, the Planetary
Logos. The same relationship also exists with respect to the
life of the sun, the lives of zodiacal systems and galaxies,
and the whole totality of the dialectical universe.
Seeing and experiencing this panorama, one must surely
come to the conclusion that the entire dialectical universe, with
all its phenomena, forms and aspects, is, in its deepest essence,
an unreality. Anything that appears and then disappears again
can surely not be called a high reality It is a self-dissolving
delusion.
What is not a delusion, and hence the reality with respect to
yourself, is the microcosm. The microcosm is eternal, real. The
personality is finite, unreal.
With regard to our cosmos there is the Planetary Logos.
With regard to the sun there is Vulcan. With regard to the
universe as a whole, there is the other All-Manifestation, the
high, great reality, the nature of the truly living waters, Tao. It
is from this Tao that the microcosm originates, as do all the
Planetary Logoi, Vulcanides and Cosmocrators.
So now you can see clearly the contrast between the material
and the non-material. The non-material — the great


BEFORE HEAVEN AND EARTH EXISTED, THERE WAS AN INDEFINITE BEING

reality of the true, divine universe — exists independently. _It
stands alone, by itself, and does not change. It pervades
everything, and yet is not endangered._ In essence it is the
Father-Mother of the other universe, the material one.
In this way, urged by Lao Tzu, we reverse our perception of
all relationships. The great reality of the unchangeable exists
in complete contrast to what we are accustomed to perceiving
as `reality', for that, in deepest essence, does not exist. How
many times have you heard yourself saying, `That is what is
important to me, that is my reality, that is my life' But if you
say things like that, you are not yet living. If only you were! If
you perceive things in that way, then, in deepest essence, you
do not exist.
Not exist What do we mean by that Well, we ask you can
things which will sooner or later dissolve and disappear truly be
called `reality' You perceive these things as reality because
you want to; because you keep on trying to hold on to them and
make them lasting.
If you were willing to realise, very deeply, that this sham-
reality is essentially unreal and to let yourself experience that,
seen from the viewpoint of Tao, what you think is real does
not in fact exist; if you were to experience, in your very soul,
the fact of not-being, then you would really be able to enter
your kingship. Then the microcosm would be seen as the rea-
lity, and the personality would know itself to be only a pro-
jection, a reflected image. The reflected image, however, is
not the reality!
Nevertheless, by means of the reflected image, the only
reality could perform a mighty work of radiation, of reflect-
ing. The one, absolute reality could manifest itself by means
of the reflected image. If you were to let go of your delusion,
if you were to tear off the jester's outfit you are wearing and
rediscover yourself as a projection of the Eternal, then this


BEFORE HEAVEN AND EARTH EXISTED, THERE WAS AN INDEFINITE BEING

mighty work of radiation would be possible. Then the light
would be able to shine in the darkness, wherever darkness
prevails.
That is the truth about not-being. And that is why we say not
I, but the God in me. Not I, but the Other One. Not I, but the
Father. Just as a projection is caused by the one who projects, so
the Son comes from the Father. That is why the Son can say,
`The Father and I are one'.
If you let go of all your self-maintenance, if the delusion that
`I am this, and I possess that,' is broken in you and taken
away from you, if all that has disappeared, then you, too, can
say `The Father and I are one.' If you dissolve yourself in not-
being, if you enter the endura and practise the great self-
surrender, if you completely neutralise your delusion of sepa-
rate, independent existence, then you will become one with the
Other One.
Then the saying will be fulfilled `He who is willing to lose his
life' — his self-seeking existence — `for my sake, shall keep
it.' The personality must begin to respond once more to the law
of the other nature. That is the mystery of existence there is an
approach to life which, if you adopt it, will enable you to create
in yourself the conditions necessary for the reality, the One, to
be able to project itself through you.
So would it not be supremely valuable to make this im-
perishable One the governing factor in your life To absorb
yourself in it, forgetting yourself, not maintaining yourself,
living in the state of not-being Then everything will come.
Everything will _be._ A mighty light will spread through the
dark regions of dialectical existence, as a blessing for many.
And the nature of death, with all its horror, will cease to exist.
If you have understood all this as it is meant to be understood,
you will be able to practise wu wei, not-doing, the endura.
This will enable the voice of the rose, the voice of


BEFORE HEAVEN AND EARTH EXISTED, THERE WAS AN INDEFINITE BEING

the monad, to make an impression on the mirror of your
heart, even though, at the moment, this mirror is rather
tarnished and blurred. Your heart will then begin to yearn for
the only possible solution.
This yearning, as we explained earlier, will stimulate the
urge towards wisdom. And while you are persevering with
your attempts to understand wisdom, until the lawful end is
reached, the tarnished mirror will be cleansed by the light and
power of the other realm. At last the moment will come when
you will begin to see `face to face'. The great reality will be
unveiled firsthand. The religion of `seeing the invisible', as
Paul calls it, will then become a way of life. The science of
divine thinking, which reflects itself into the mind, will then
lead to the practice of the great art.
So, when you understand not-doing, and you practise it as
a way of life, everything is set free. Reality, the absolute
Being, can reflect itself into the non-being. Like a new sun,
the great glory will spread its dawn throughout the nature of
antitheses, which will once more become the training school
of eternity.
How could one define that joy, that glory We do not
know its name. We call it Tao. Were we compelled to
describe it, we would call it `great'. After `great', we would
call it `ephemeral'; after `ephemeral', `distant'; after `distant',
`That which returns'. For there are mighty forces, wheeling
and circling, which hold everything in their embrace. An
immense plan lies at the foundation of the divine universe.
This plan _must_ be fulfilled. And it _will_ be fulfilled!
How By projection, by reflection. In this way, the plan
projects an alchemical workplace, an astral reality which
serves as a place in which the work can be performed. Into
this forge, the microcosms descend — and the cosmocrators,
and all the sublime ones who are of God's generation.


BEFORE HEAVEN AND EARTH EXISTED, THERE WAS AN INDEFINITE BEING

The hammer blows ring out and the songs resound, the joy-
ous songs of those who are working on the one, great plan of
all-realisation. The architect is That which projects itself. The
workers are the projected, vivified forces and beings.
The great wonder becomes a reality — the Mysterium
Magnum, the Great Work!



```
25 - III
```
## 25— III The fourfold law of Tao

```
At the end of chapter 25 of the Tao Te Ching we read
```
```
Tao is great, heaven is great, the earth is great, the King is
great. There are four great powers in the world, and the King is
one of them. The King's law is of the earth, the law of the earth
is of heaven, and the law of heaven is of Tao. But the law of Tao
is of itself.
These words give a picture of the whole fullness of manifes-
tation. It clearly shows two extremes Tao, on the one hand, and
the King on the other. The King is the human personality, who
has become capable of reflecting in a pure way all the intentions
latent within Tao.
That is why all holy scriptures compare the human per-
sonality-system with a temple, and why, from time to time
human beings have been reproached with the question `Do
you not know that you are the temple of God' The temple of
God is the temple of the Kingship of the Spirit, the temple of
the royal, priestly race. It is the temple in which the high
intentions of Tao must be given expression. A radiation
emanates from Tao. Similarly, therefore, a radiation
emanates from that aspect of your being which has originated
from Tao, namely the microcosm or monad. Through this
radiation everything latent in the microcosm can be brought
to expression; it can be projected.
We would like you to visualise this clearly, because it is
what Lao Tzu wants you to understand. The personality
human being is intended to be the projection, the expression
of an eternally existing Being. If separated from that Being,
```

```
THE FOURFOLD LAW OF TAO
```
the projection's existence becomes a non-existence. Only in
combination do they form the divine reality. Without this
cooperation, in total harmony and mutual understanding, the
personality-system becomes a curse and is delivered to des-
truction. The monad then becomes one of the living-dead, like
the sphinx of the Egyptian mysteries.
So all who wish to participate in the new consciousness will
have to make tremendous efforts in order to reach their goal.
They will need to adopt a new, practical approach to life from
which they do not deviate, whatever the circumstances, and
whose aim is attunement to all the radiations emanating from
the one, central Being.
The human being receives not only life from the Godhead,
but also radiant, living instructions. That is why in the
beginning there is always the Word.
In this context it is perhaps useful to point out that origi-
nally, religious practice took quite a different form than it
does now. The original, priestly human being was not some-
one who performed rituals and chanted prayers, but someone
who applied directly-received, divine instructions. Whatever
the monad projected, whatever radiations it poured in, were
immediately understood and applied in practice. This conver-
sion into form of the monadic radiations was what was meant
by `service'.
To understand this you need only look at the ancient
meaning of the word `priest'. The priests of antiquity were not
ministers of religious rituals and ceremonies. In ancient
times, the word `priest' was synonymous with `sage'. Via the
living soul-state of this sage, the spirit projected itself into the
personality. The priestly human being lived in and through
that power and was completely in harmony with Tao. He
could not be otherwise.
Those who belonged to this race of king-priests formed the


```
THE FOURFOLD LAW OF TAO
```
true Brotherhood of divine human beings, the Order of Mel-
chizedek, of which Jesus Christ is called the High Priest. This
Order maintained a law, the law of the true human state, the
law of Tao as a living reality. In this way, `as above' became
`so below'. The law of Tao was the law of the King, the royal
human being, and it related to the whole task that had to be
fulfilled on earth.
Whenever a group of king-priests like these really begins to
carry out a task on earth, then a sanctifying, blessing influence
is bound to emanate from them and spread over the whole
earth. In this way, the earth is glorified through human
kingship. A glorified earth becomes one with heaven, with a
purified astral field and, inevitably, this ascent will reveal the
majesty of Tao itself.
Bow then, if you really understand these things, before the
four great powers and the fourfold law, the law of kingship, the
earth, heaven and Tao. Be profoundly aware that God is light.
Through light the Godhead, the reality, the truth of Tao
becomes manifest in you, and throughout heaven and earth.
What, then, is required of the human being in order to make
these four truths a reality First of all the great purification of
wu wei, of not-being, not-doing, self-surrender. Secondly,
through self-surrender, the rebirth of the soul. This makes
possible, thirdly, the reunification of the consciousness with
the radiation of the monad. Then, fourthly, the personality-
being will be able to `move' in harmony with Tao, which
means he will manifest Tao through his actions. Thus the
fourfold law of the divine plenitude will have been restored.
To move with Tao means to have restored the age-old
rhythm of Tao in one's being. That is why, long ago, this
movement was referred to as a dance. But in later times
this knowledge was lost, and dance-ritual became at best
an approximation of the real dance, which had to be re-

stored in the human being by living in the reality of
Tao.
Through the radiations of the light, atoms are set
in motion. They begin to revolve. In this way,
whirling vortices are set up in the astral substance,
the wheels of the mysteries, the wheels of creation.
He who sees these fiery wheels must consciously and
positively travel with them; he must move in
harmony with this pattern of forces, until their aim
has been completely fulfilled.
`I saw a storm wind coming out of the north,
driving before it a black cloud, with brightness round
about it, and fire flashing forth continually. There in
the midst appeared a shining metal. And in the midst
thereof came the likeness of four living creatures [...]
Each of them had four wings [...] They flashed like
rays of lightning hither and thither. While I looked at
them, I saw upon the earth beside each of the living
creatures a wheel, sparkling like turquoise [...] As
the beings moved, the wheels beside them moved
also.'


_Gravity is the root of what is light; stillness is the master of
movement._

_That is why the sage never separates himself from gravity and
stillness._

_Though there may be much beauty to behold, he keeps himself
in stillness and detachment._

_But alas, the Lord of ten thousand chariots thinks the light of
the kingdom exists through his own doing._

_By regarding his ministers as being of minor importance,
he loses them. By allowing himself to be carried away, he
loses his authority._

## 26 — I Gravity is the root of what is light

You know what gravitation is and how it works. Modern
human beings are particularly preoccupied by it, judging by the
enormous efforts being made by scientists to overcome the
gravitational forces of the earth.
Every object in space, including the earth, has an electro-
magnetic power of attraction. As a result of this power,
everything that belongs to the earth, everything that is of the
same essence, is prevented from leaving; it is kept in its place
and in this way is provided with the opportunity to live.
Gravitational forces have two aspects, two properties. The
most obvious one is the power of attraction. The other is
repulsion. Through the power of repulsion everything that does
not belong to the earth, and thus might be harmful to it or its
creatures, is kept outside the system.
The twofold effect of gravitation originates from the tenth
stratum of our earth. This is the heart of the earth, where the
central focus of the Earth Spirit is to be found. This focal
point deep within the earth determines the gravitational
effects of all the other nine earth-strata, which include the
two aspects of the material sphere, the four aspects of the
etheric sphere, the astral sphere, and the two aspects of the
mental sphere. So all the fields in which the personality is
manifested are under the control of the gravitational
influences emanating from the Earth Spirit.
This also applies to the vehicles of the personality itself,
which, apart from the material body, also include the etheric
body, the astral body, and a rudimentary mental body which is
still in the process of development. In other words, it is not


```
GRAVITY IS THE ROOT OF WHAT IS LIGHT
```
only the material body which is attracted by the Earth Spirit,
but also the etheric body, the astral body and the mental parts
of the personality.
This explains why the wheel of birth and death and its
effects are confined to the Earth Spirit's various planes of
manifestation. If a space traveller is able by mechanical
means to escape the gravitational pull of the immediate,
physical plane, he must next pass into the gravitational field
of the etheric planes, then into that of the astral planes and
finally into that of the mental border planes. Beyond that is
nothingness as far as his personality is concerned, emptiness,
because beyond that point quite different electromagnetic
laws of gravity apply, which require quite different astral,
mental, etheric and material conditions.
This outermost limit is set for every mortal, because the
personality's centre of gravity coincides with the heart of the
earth, and is therefore bound to the Planetary Spirit. This also
applies to the microcosm and to all the previous personality-
lives that unfolded within it. No microcosm can ever simply
detach itself from the confinement of this electromagnetic
sphere. However, as explained in the previous chapters, there is
yet another earth, completely invisible to the nature-born
mortal, even though philosophically demonstrable. It is the
holy Earth, the planetary system of the Planetary Logos.
The Universal Doctrine draws a distinction between the
Planetary Spirit, which has to do with our material earth, and
the Planetary Logos. The Planetary Logos is the Lord of the
original, inviolable, divine planet, the ineffable, eternal glory.
From this holy Earth, from this original planet, our planet has
emerged as a training school, a field of development which
the microcosm must enter in order, after completing its
studies, to ascend from it and return to the House of the


```
GRAVITY IS THE ROOT OF WHAT IS LIGHT
```
Father. So the Planetary Logos is the beginning — the alpha
— and at the same time the end — the omega.
Hence the great goal underlying the existence of every
microcosm is to complete the journey, to celebrate the omega,
and then to hear the words `See, I make all things new. Write,
for these words are trustworthy and true. I am the Alpha and
the Omega, the beginning and the end. I shall give the thirsty
to drink from the fountain of the water of life, freely.'
The point we want to impress on you is that two natures of
which the Gnosis testifies are intimately connected. Even
though they are quite distinct from one another, the two solar
systems and the planets they contain — including our earth
and the holy Earth — are fully interpenetrating. So the
microcosm contains not only the `land of exile' but also the
`Land of the Father'. And that is why you are told that `the
kingdom of God is within you.'
The microcosm which surrounds you is the absolute aspect
of the original planet, the holy Earth. The personality is of
the earth-earthly. The microcosm originates from the House
of the Father; the personality originates from the dialectical
nature. To the personality it can be said that `the kingdom of
God is within you.'
Isn't that an exaggeration Wouldn't it be better to say that
`the kingdom of God is very near to you' No! To
understand why, you need a clear conception of the
relationship between the Planetary Spirit and the Planetary
Logos. It is said of the Planetary Spirit that its reality is a
mystery. It is an entity in development, a development in an
upward direction. The Planetary Spirit is intimately
connected with the Planetary Logos and carries out all its
commands. It is the projection of the Planetary Logos and, as
you know, its focus lies in the heart of the earth.


GRAVITY IS THE ROOT OF WHAT IS LIGHT
Now look at yourself. There is a microcosm _and_ there is a
personality. The microcosm is of God's generation; the per-
sonality is subject to space and time. The whole sphere of
activity of the personality — with its the material, etheric,
astral and mental aspects — is determined by the heart of the
personality. The electromagnetic condition and the quality of
the personality — what it attracts, what it repels, what it is
indifferent towards — all this is determined by the state, the
nature, the disposition of the heart. The heart is therefore the
primary focus of every human life. That is why a brother of the
Rosycross once said `What the heart does not want, cannot
enter the head.'
So it is easy to see why chapter 26 of the Tao Te Ching
examines the mortal human being's centre of gravity and
explains where it is situated. Where does the centre of gravity
in _your_ life lie That is the question! It is the most important
thing in your whole existence, because the heart's centre of
gravity is your central focus and gives direction to everything
that happens to you in the course of your life.

_Gravity is the root of what is light. Stillness is the master of
movement. That is why the sage never separates himself from
gravity and stillness._

We can now understand what this means. There is a centre
of gravity, a source which determines the way your life is
oriented. Its seat lies in the heart. The state of your heart
determines your centre of gravity. This gravitational force
is the very ground of your existence, of everything you do
and do not do.
You see someone doing or not doing certain things. You ask
yourself in disbelief, `How can he do such a thing' Or, smiling
with approval, you exclaim, `How wonderful!' All these
actions, positive as well as negative, proceed from the


```
GRAVITY IS THE ROOT OF WHAT IS LIGHT
```
individual's centre of gravity which is seated in the heart. So
your life is like a plant whose root is embedded in your heart,
and which you are bringing into the light of the living present.
That is why _gravity is the root of what is light._ Your centre of
gravity is the root of what emerges into the light of your life's
actuality.
The actuality of your life is movement, a constant activity,
whose nature is visible and whose fruits are demonstrable. To
enable this movement, this growth and its results, there has to
be energy. So there is a root — there is energy — there is
movement — and then there is a result.
Now suppose your centre of gravity were rooted in the
Gnosis. The energy that would then give rise to movement in
your life could be referred to as `peace', or `stillness'. The
stillness of your heart would then be the master of
movement. In the letter to the Hebrews, the whole of
chapter four is devoted to this stillness. The letter is
addressed to people who are learning about the one path
that leads to stillness, and it tells them `Therefore, while the
promise of entering his rest remains, let us fear lest any of you
be judged to have failed to reach it. Let us therefore strive to
enter that rest.'
If the human being's centre of gravity is rooted in the Gnosis,
a certain energy, a movement, will emanate from it.
Something is brought into the light; the fruit becomes visible.
This fruit, this living result, is inner peace, stillness, that
glorious state of being which passes all understanding. And this
result becomes the master of movement.
So it seems that a profound mystery is connected with the
heart, and you are capable of solving it. It is the mystery of
how to transfer your life's centre of gravity, the root of your
existence, from the depths of the earth to the primordial
ground of the Logos. If you are familiar with the Bible you
will know that a great deal of it is focused on that problem


```
GRAVITY IS THE ROOT OF WHAT IS LIGHT
```
how to attain liberation from the earth-earthly and enter the
eternal glory of the other planet, the holy Earth, which John
saw descending out of heaven, because he had become
entirely one with it.
How does a pupil of a School like ours achieve this How
does the gnostic method help him to solve this mystery
The sage who has solved this mystery _never separates
himself from gravity and stillness,_ says Lao Tzu. Because his
centre of gravity has established roots in the Other Life; it has
been transferred to the Other One. Once he has tasted this
glory, he will certainly never be willing to give it up for the
fruits of darkness.
We urge you to prepare yourself so that, with us, you can
solve this glorious mystery.



# 26 - ii

## 26— II The three crosses

```
In the human heart lies the seat of life, the nuclear power of the
monad, the immortal rose. This rose is characterised by a
strongly radiant, multicoloured light, which emanates from it.
The seat of the rose coincides with the apex of the heart sanc-
tuary. Its presence means that every nature-born human being is
a potential rosicrucian, for the rose of the personality is always
fixed to the cross.
This rose is the representative of the Planetary Logos in the
nature-born human being. So the original kingdom is within us.
The path and the law of life touch us. They are part of our
system.
The heart has seven aspects, seven ventricles, each of
which has a sevenfold activity. So it should be possible to
cause seven times seven rays to emanate from the persona-
lity-system, with the rose as the central point.
Now if we visualise the rose as a radiant five-pointed star of
Bethlehem, and the heart as a shining circle from which the
seven times seven rays emanate, we will have before us the
mighty symbol displayed above the place of service in our
temple in Haarlem. This is the most wonderful symbol we
could ever encounter. It is the voice of the Christ in us. It is
God in the flesh.
In the exact centre of the microcosm, coinciding with the
heart of the nature-born personality — yes, actually in the
heart of the nature-born personality — we are born of God,
we exist in the life-field of absolute Being, we participate
in the heaven-earth, and we stand in the wide embrace of
the alpha and the omega, the beginning and end.
```

THE THREE CROSSES
Nevertheless, there is a formidable obstruction, for in
addition to this mighty, glorious, spiritual Being, we possess
another, quite different consciousness. It is seated in the head
sanctuary. It is the ego, the animal or intellectual conscious-
ness. The consciousness of the rose is transpersonal, divine,
whereas the I-consciousness is an aspect of the personality.
That is why it is animal and mortal. And would it not be true
to say that your life's centre of gravity lies in your head
That is fine if you want nothing more from life than the
journey, as a personality, from the cradle to the grave. But it is
not fine at all — it is crazy — if you are seeking and aiming at
the life of absolute reality. For you cannot possibly participate
in or gain access to the great reality with your intellectual
consciousness.
The I-centrality, the I-consciousness, in which your centre
of gravity probably lies, must subordinate itself completely to
the transpersonal, to the Lord of Life, who dwells in the heart.
The centre of gravity of your life must be transferred totally
from the head to the heart. Then the great miracle will reveal
itself to you.
That is the endura, the turning of one's entire being inward,
towards the true self, the highest self, towards the Lord of Life
in you. The endura does not direct you outward, but inward,
towards the holy, golden rose, which radiates from its dwelling-
place in the heart.
You must understand this very clearly. It is a process you
can begin right now, today. But you need to bear in mind that
your heart is very polluted, very impure and damaged. Why
Because of the I-delusion that has prevailed throughout
almost countless past existences in your microcosm, and that
still governs you because the gravitational focus of your life
still lies in the head sanctuary, in the I-consciousness.
That is why the first task ahead of you — and it is an immense


```
THE THREE CROSSES
```
one — is the purification of the heart. That is what `making
straight the paths' means! If you do not begin with that, if you
do not succeed in that, your pupilship will be meaningless.
Please understand this as it is meant. We do not mean that you
must give up reason and exchange it for a kind of mystical
emotion. For that would amount to nothing more than an
attempt of the I-consciousness to ensure its safety in the
polluted and damaged heart. Three crosses are erected on the
hill of Golgotha
In the centre is the cross of Christian Rosycross, the self that
emanates from the radiant, golden rose, the self that can over-
come all things and gain the victory.
Beside it is the cross of the hardened, I-central self, which
lives in the delusion that _it_ is the all-knowing, all-possessing
ruler in the nature of death. It is the part of you that does not
know the one path and therefore mocks and rejects it. Is this self
not the absolute murderer of the true self, the greatest enemy of
the God within
On the other side we see the third figure the human being
struggling for a way out. He represents the person who is
engaged in shifting his centre of gravity to the heart, the per-
son who is seeking the new orientation, the new `movement'
from within the centre of gravity of the heart. He is the person
who hunts for true inner peace and tranquillity. He desires to
water the root of the one life with the sacrifice of his entire
self, right to the last drop of blood. For the displacement of his
centre of gravity will mean his ultimate relief, and will lead
him into the stillness which is the master of the movement.
However, the lasting, radiant light and the inner peace
which passes all understanding have not yet reached maturity.
The centre of gravity has been shifted, the foundation has
been laid. But now the total purification of the heart has to
take place, the absolute emptying, the fundamental reversal,


```
THE THREE CROSSES
```
the endura, the process of `dying while living'.
This work has seven times seven aspects. It is a laborious
struggle during which a great deal will have to be suffered,
especially in the beginning, for one is bound to stumble and fall
many times. That is why the person in this phase is still, in
many respects, a murderer of his highest, divine self.
But he _knows_ the Other One. He knows `this is the son of
God', and he perseveres, keeping his eye, his centre of gravity,
constantly on this fount of grace and truth. That is why he is
able to hear the voice of the Other One, who speaks to him the
most glorious words that can be addressed to a human being `I
say unto you, you shall be with me in Paradise.'
You need to free these words from their traditional, biblical
veils. Then you will taste the pure Gnosis and you will know
that all these values lie within your reach. From this divine
fount in you, the absolute, eternal wisdom can begin to flow
abundantly. If the mortal human being is able, through constant
perseverance, to overcome all resistances and attain to wisdom,
he will never again be the murderer of his divine self. Never
again will he need to give up his newly attained centre of
gravity, and he will enter the eternal stillness

_Though there may still be much beauty to behold, he keeps
himself in stillness and detachment._

So now you can understand what is required of you — not by
the School, but by your highest, divine self. At the moment,
you are lived and governed by the intellectual self, by the brain
consciousness, which is nothing more than the product of your
karmic and hereditary past. It is nothing more than the outer
form, the house in which the rose has chosen to dwell.
But why let the form predominate Surely it is the inhabitant
of the form, the dweller in the house, that should take first
priority Yet in most people there is at best a chaotic,


```
THE THREE CROSSES
```
haphazard interaction between the house and its occupant,
and between the head and the heart. Sometimes the problems
of the head are given precedence over those of the heart,
while at other times the situation is reversed, and in this way
heart and head come into conflict with each other. The result
is confusion and inner dividness. And when, forgetting your
task, your calling, you allow the form to dominate over the
essence, you unfortunately bring about the situation in which
_the Lord of ten thousand chariots thinks the light of the
kingdom exists through his own doing._
As the form, as the personality-house, your vocation is to
give the rose the opportunity to manifest itself fully, to allow it
to rule over the form, so that it can constantly transfigure the
form for each task that will be required of it on the great jour-
ney of development. Therefore the form, the personality, needs
to behave in such a way that it will see the heaven-earth
descend into its own being, since that is how the great aim will
be achieved.
So the form is not useless or worthless, but is one of the
essential ingredients in the process, just as our planet earth is
essential to the task of the heaven-earth. That is why, in the
terminology of Lao Tzu, the form is called the `Lord of ten
thousand chariots'. In other words, it is very strong, powerful,
gifted, and equipped with great abilities.
However, if the form-being is aware of something of that
great might and ability, and as a result begins to regard the
divine self as being of minor importance, placing his own
self centrally and allowing his own interests to take priority,
he will lose his abilities. He will lose his ministers. And by
allowing himself to be carried away by this delusion, he will
lose his connection with reality and the authority that gives
him, and thus his fall will be total. That is why we urge you
to shift your centre of gravity without delay, so that you can


```
THE THREE CROSSES
```
make your form into a temple in which the God within you can
dwell. That is what the sage does. He _never separates himself
from gravity and stillness._
Nature-born people of our times often show signs of
degeneration. This is because the centre of gravity of their
lives is rooted primarily in the intellectual brain conscious-
ness. From that centre they may try to live the life of gnostic
pupilship. In this way, at most, they achieve a state, an experi-
ence, of religious observance, a life in which they sincerely try
to serve God, the School and the Gnosis. But this state of
pupilship is constantly being broken up and undermined, and
cannot be sustained in the face of the problems of dialectical
life. For in essence, nothing changes when one tries to serve
the Gnosis with the I-consciousness, with the intellectual
consciousness.
Seen from the point of view of the divine plan, this kind of
religious observance is false; it has no foundation in reality. So
you should strive not to imitate God, but to become _one_ with
God. That is the destiny of all creation. That is the plan. That is
your calling. That is why the rose of roses dwells in your heart
to make possible your unification, your union with the
Godhead which is within you.
Religious observance is therefore always a compromise.
At most, it is a starting point. But if you remain at the starting
point, without going any further, your religious observance
will turn into ego observance. That is why, in the nature of
death, there is always a conflict between religious and anti-
religious people. That is why the field of religion is so rife
with all kinds of experiments and confusion. That is why
religious groups are constantly appealing to each other to
unite.
These ideas may be new to you, so may we suggest you
take some time to think them over Then confusion will no


```
THE THREE CROSSES
```
longer torment you. Shift the centre of gravity of your life.
Make your form into the forecourt of a threefold temple.
Carry out the purification of your heart, and thus prepare for
an encounter with the God within you. Then He will be able
to enter the sanctuary.
The path of the Gnosis is the path of becoming one with
God, and not the path of religious observance. The sage
knows this, and puts it into practice. That is why he never
ceases to seek and to find his centre of gravity in the still
point at the centre of his being.


# 26 - Ill

## 26— III The threefold mastery

```
As we said in the previous chapter, the three crosses — the
cross of the I-being imprisoned in itself, the cross of the
human being struggling for liberation, and the cross of the
self that overcomes all things — are erected on the hill of
Golgotha, the place of the skull.
That may have struck you as odd. Why, if the centre of
gravity of true life has to be anchored in the heart sanctuary,
must the three crosses be erected in the place of the skull, in
the head sanctuary, which we have been calling the seat of
the intellectual consciousness
To understand this you need to realise that the results of the
purification of the heart are always revealed in the head sanc-
tuary. It is the head sanctuary which has to be prepared as the
higher self's place of service, in which the ultimate victory
will be attained. The head sanctuary is also the place in which
the total defeat of the I-consciousness must be manifested.
The rose-power wells up from the heart; in the heart lies the
root. But the awakening, the enlightenment, the resurrection,
is manifested in the head.
As soon as the ruler of the form has surrendered his domi-
nion over it, the living soul-prince stands radiant in his place.
Of the three crosses, only one of them will be able to etch its
signature, its sign, in the mirror of the forehead either the
sign of the I-being, or the sign of the struggling soul which
has received the promise of grace, or the sign of the Son of
Man.
Now, perhaps, you can understand better than ever before
```

```
THE THREEFOLD MASTERY
```
the miraculous events of the seventh day of _The Alchemical
Wedding of Christian Rosycross._ All who really want to bring
the wondrous rose into full bloom are finally assembled in the
tower of Olympus. This tower has seven floors, just as the heart
has seven aspects, seven ventricles. The purification of the
heart is a sevenfold labour. The great work of pupilship is a
sevenfold task which requires the pupil's utmost devotion.
When Christian Rosycross has performed this work, he
ascends to an unknown eighth floor, a vault directly beneath the
roof. And it is there that the victory is revealed, the all-
conquering rebirth of the Rosycross. The gate of eternity,
symbolised since ancient times by the number eight, is opened
wide. Resurrection has become a fact.
Through the work of preparation we call `the alchemical
wedding', which is made possible because we allow the rose of
the heart to govern the life of the form, a completely new
system of personality-vehicles is built up, with some mira-
culous characteristics, which can be manifested once it has
been fully resurrected.
The first of these is mastery over the material sphere of the
earth. The second is mastery over the etheric sphere of the
earth. The third is mastery over the astral and mental aspects of
the earth.
Among other things, this threefold mastery brings with it
full consciousness in all the vehicles of the renewed persona-
lity. This has some peculiar results. For instance, the material
garment remains bound to time and space, but in the other
vehicles of the renewed personality, time and space lose their
significance and ultimately cease to exist. So if brothers or
sisters of the Rosycross find themselves spatially at a certain
point on our globe, it will not be difficult for them to be
somewhere else at the same time. From the point of view of


```
THE THREEFOLD MASTERY
```
time and space, he is omnipresent throughout all domains of
the earth. Though apparently bound to matter, he is in reality
totally free.
You will easily see how tremendously significant this is if
you give it a little thought. It explains how the group unity of
all the brothers and sisters of the great soul-community is rea-
lised. All the enormous burdens of life in the world of time
and space simply fall away.
Jesus the Lord's appearances between his resurrection
and his ascension were meant to prove this fact to his
disciples and pupils. Abundant confirmation of this life-
state is also given in the gnostic gospel of the _Pistis Sophia._
What mystics call the `ascension' means not only being
admitted to the world of the Planetary Spirit as a totally
new human being, but also being no longer of this world. It
means belonging to the world of the original, divine life-
state, the world of the Earth Logos, the heaven-earth of
John.
Try to see clearly how this glory can unfold for you the
pilgrims to eternity gathered in our group need to make
straight their paths. They need to place their Rosycross on
the hill of Golgotha. They must do these things with all the
power that is in them. Then their Living Body, their
celestial ship, will be able to move forwards and upwards,
until at last, the moment will be reached when some of the
brothers and sisters can celebrate their ascension. This will
release tremendous power, which will spread over the whole
Living Body, fulfilling the glorious promise of Pentecost
`You will receive the power of the Holy Spirit, which shall
come upon all of you, and you shall be my witnesses unto
the ends of the earth.'
You can prepare yourself for this approaching, eternal feast
of Pentecost by choosing the right centre of gravity, and thus
becoming master of all movement.

## 27— I The Only Good

```
Looking at the text of chapter 27 of the Tao Te Ching, it is
easy to see that Lao Tzu is speaking about a fivefold approach
to life and the five forms of goodness which are its signature.
However, the goodness Lao Tzu means must be quite dif-
ferent from the kind ordinary, nature-born people possess and
know. For the goodness Lao Tzu is talking about creates quite
different results than ordinary, human goodness.
Lao Tzu is speaking about the hermetic Only Good. The
ordinary human being, however, knows only the kind good
which is inseparable from its companion, evil. That is why it
is so important to draw your attention to this difference right
at the beginning of the chapter, because Lao Tzu's words can-
not be understood properly unless you remember that he is
speaking from the perspective of a world quite different from
the one familiar to you. The laws of this other world, and the
way of life in keeping with those laws, are not at all
applicable in ordinary nature. If you were to forget this, any
reflection on the ancient Chinese wisdom would only lead to
misunderstanding, and that would be bound to cause
difficulties in your life.
The great reality of the two natures is no longer a familiar
idea in this world — your world. The fact that the kingdom
of the spirit is not of this world has long been forgotten. Yet
the age-old doctrine of the two natures is the key to under-
standing how the path to liberation is followed. Anyone who
has lost or can no longer use this key, and can therefore no
longer find the path that leads back to the Kingdom of the
Father, will become hopelessly entangled in the labyrinth of
```

```
THE ONLY GOOD
```
the nature of death. In the light of this information, we would
like to take a look at two very common phenomena which
are actually the products of life in our world theology and
humanism.

Many people want to serve God and try to understand the
Bible, because they wish to reach the state of eternal bless-
edness. This leads them to make desperate efforts to be truly
`good` and to spread goodness in the world around them. In
their feelings, thoughts and actions, they try to conform to
the requirements of goodness.
But even at the very beginning of this struggle, the painful
fact is clear that, as soon as you want to do good, evil walks
beside you. It even appears that, precisely because you are
genuinely trying to do good, you end up doing evil. Or it
turns out that your goodness has negative results, that your
goodness is not enough, that nothing comes of it. Or that the
initially positive result quickly crystallises and petrifies to a
mineral-like remnant of what once lived spontaneously.
How does that come about Theologians, in their blind-
ness, denied the inescapable conclusion that the goodness
they practised and preached to their congregations, could not
be real, that it could not have anything to do with the Only
Good. Instead, they preferred to invent the `devil'. And by
doing so, those who were so afraid of evil and so much
wanted to be good, consolidated evil as an astral reality.
It is easy to see how this can happen. If, in your naivety, you
were to think you, as a nature-born person, were good and had
done right, and yet things turned out quite differently to what
you had imagined, you would be quite likely to deduce the
existence of an anti-force, an adversary who must have been
responsible. And then the devil would exist, for if only


```
THE ONLY GOOD
```
you think long enough about evil, you give it form, because
of the attributes of the astral substance.
If that embodiment then begins to hinder you — and it will
do so, since you are its creator and you therefore experience
it as your devil — then you can tell all your followers about
that experience and formulate doctrines about it. And all
those who follow in your footsteps will amplify the negative
astral embodiment originally made by just one person into a
monstrous being that hinders the whole of humanity and
poisons the astral sphere.
That is why we repeat the gnostic truth the cause of per-
sonified evil lies in the goodness of this nature. In that fact
lies the negativity, the hopelessness of all theology, of all
nature-religion. It would be most helpful if you understood
this and were willing to accept it as the basic assumption of
your new life in the Gnosis. As Jesus the Lord says, `No one
is good — not even one!' May God grant that you will under-
stand these words.
The order of existence which humanity knows and experi-
ences and from which its birth in nature is to be explained, is
a dialectical one, which means to say that it is not, and never
can be, an _absolute_ reality. Every phenomenon in it, every
characteristic or attribute it could possibly possess, is subject
to the law of antitheses. Things appear and, sooner or later,
they disappear. So nothing in this world can possibly be
absolute; the absolute cannot possibly manifest itself in this
alternating movement of rising and setting.
Yet the idea, the dream of the Only Good does lie within the
human being. Even in the worst criminal, a dream of the good
exists. But with their nature-born form and in the nature of
dialectics the good, the Only Good, cannot possibly be rea-
lised. `No one is good — not even one!' If, going against all


```
THE ONLY GOOD
```
these natural laws, the ego nevertheless tries to attain this
goodness, and wrongly calls its goodness `love', then it will
only cause much sharper contrasts and the differences between
light and darkness will become much, much more painful. For
the laws of nature must be fulfilled, and in the alternation of
opposites, the light the human ego wishes to hold on to and
keep is bound to turn into darkness, and its love into hate. The
ego's reality will be lost in delusion and its life in futility. And
in its struggle to keep and make permanent what may not be
kept, with all the resulting emotional and mental activities, the
ego establishes evil as an astral reality in its individual life-
sphere and in the world as a whole.
That is the reality in the delusion of dialectics and through
it the whole astral sphere has been ruined by hordes of ar-
chons and aeons — the harvest of religion as it is practised in
this nature.

That is why so many people, in the course of the centuries,
turned away from religion and took to humanism instead.
The negative result of religion was so clear, the chaos it
caused so great, that the revolution _had_ to come. For the
goodness people had been striving for had not been _so_ good
as to preclude their seeking the best for themselves. All this
self-seeking gave a powerful stimulus to the development of
the I-consciousness and the resulting struggle for existence
eventually produced huge contrasts between poverty and
wealth, between the suffering of the oppressed and the extra-
vagance of the rich.
This was the soil in which humanism germinated; the
struggle for freedom, fought by the proletariat of all nations.
A powerful urge towards goodness erupted in all those who
wanted to help the oppressed. Democracy was born and
human rights were held up as a call to freedom. A number of


```
THE ONLY GOOD
```
movements were set up to help the poor and oppressed. The
whole of Europe shook with philanthropic aspirations.
This led to a peak of anti-religious feeling. What the church
could not do, humanism in its many forms would accomplish.
Europe reached the pinnacle of civilisation goodness was to
be scientifically applied; all men would be brothers. The few
remaining blemishes would soon be a thing of the past.
But look what, in our present century, was brought in on
this wave of goodness such a ghastly horror, such a dreadful
pestilence, such a savage, scientifically calculated carnage, as
has never been seen throughout the whole of world history, or
even prehistory. In our School, we lament the terrible fate of
the Cathars, the brothers and sisters of the preceding Brother-
hood, and rightly so. But the behaviour of their murderers
was like the frolics of a kindergarten class compared with
what our century has shown us.
Our enlightened, humane century, dripping with goodness,
has broken all records in the fields of blood-thirstiness,
cruelty, scientific extermination and insanity. The pinnacle of
goodness has brought into the open the pinnacle of human
damnable baseness — and it is still going on, even now. The
human misery of the present moment is indescribable. We
will spare you the details. You know them!
Where has human civilisation led us In what labyrinth
have we been lost The labyrinth of delusion, shot through
with blood and tears! Goodness No one is good — not even
one! It is one great big, total failure the religion of nature-
born egos, the humanism of nature-born egos, the science of
nature-born egos.
Perhaps you do not entirely agree with us. Well then,
experience will teach you. Human goodness has left behind
too many traces — one great gaping wound, so huge that
everyone can see it. The world has become one ghastly

charnel-house, despite religion, humanism, science and
everything else.
And now Lao Tzu says to us _He whose movement is good
will leave no tracks._ How can such a standpoint be defended in
the stark light of the living present We will try to answer this
question in the next chapter.



# 27 - ii

## 27— II He whose movement is good will leave no tracks

```
We would like to look at the initial verses of chapter 27 of
Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching
He whose movement is good will leave no tracks. He whose
speech is good will not give cause for blame. He whose
counting is good will need no tally. He whose closing is good
will need no bolts, yet no man will be able to open what he
has shut. He whose binding is good will need no knots, yet no
man will be able to loosen what he has bound.
```
```
The first sentence of this section He whose movement is
good will leave no tracks, is rather strange and difficult to
understand if you perceive it in the light of what is going on
in the world today.
On the face of it, all who have sought and found contact
with the gnostic Spiritual School are `good people`. They are
known to be good. However, though their goodness may be
religious, or humane, or a combination of both, it is neverthe-
less a product of their nature-born ego.
Can you honestly say that your attempts at goodness have
never left deep tracks behind them Perhaps you have been
thinking about this since you read the previous chapter.
Haven't there been many times when your goodness has
caused deep wounds Haven't you set limits on your good-
ness, only doing good towards those you thought deserved it
Has this never aroused jealousy in others How many times
have you embroiled others in difficulties, precisely because of
your efforts to help them And why do you act so kindly
```

```
HE WHOSE MOVEMENT IS GOOD WILL LEAVE NO TRACKS
```
towards some people, whilst showing a complete absence of
kindness towards others
It is worth thinking deeply about questions like these
because, in fact, your attempts at goodness have left many,
deep tracks behind them. These tracks prove all too clearly
that you are _not_ someone `whose movement is good'. You
certainly look nice enough. Nature-born goodness is your
signature. But there is a saying `He is not as nice as he
looks'. The fact is that your goodness, however good it may
be, still leaves tracks; it carves deep grooves in the soul. The
goodness of the human ego, whether applied by individuals or
by groups, always makes a mess of things.
Sages know this and they warn people about it. They allow
you to see and taste your own reality, and it causes you pain.
How can you resolve this problem
Virtue and knowledge can help you. The powerful urge
towards religion, or humanism, or the artistic appreciation of
beauty, or the acquisition of knowledge, or a combination of
these things, which you have been feeling ever since your
youth, is actually something very remarkable, and it can form
the basis for a totally new life. For this urge is in fact caused by
the touch of the rose-power, of the Kingdom of God within you.
All you need to do now is to turn this inner basis into an
absolute virtue, into a liberating virtue.
So the basis for virtue is present within you. But there is
more, for knowledge, too, is present within you, and it is there
for you to use. Please understand this as it is meant. We do not
mean the knowledge you learned at school, the kind of
knowledge you need to get through life in the world of anti-
theses. We mean knowledge of the one true life, the Universal
Doctrine. This Doctrine of Life is engraved in the primordial
atom, and the Gnosis reveals it to you in order to stimulate and
hence to set free, in your own inner being, the path to true


```
HE WHOSE MOVEMENT IS GOOD WILL LEAVE NO TRACKS
```
knowledge. So if only you can combine that knowledge with
virtue — with your inner urge to be good, and to do good — it
can and will set you free.
However, you need to take to heart Chuang Tzu's warning
`Virtue and knowledge are dangerous means and may not be
used recklessly. If your virtue is real and your fidelity is firm,
but these things do not permeate your mind, what then'
The urge towards perfect virtue, towards radiant goodness,
is deeply anchored in many people. Similarly, there are many
who, intellectually, have the whole of gnostic philosophy at
their command. These are wonderful possessions! The former
group is led by the heart, the latter by the head. However,
separated from one another, these two attributes are useless
and even dangerous. And even if the heart and head are
allowed to function together, this can still leave deep tracks if
the ego of nature still rules your life.
Furthermore, says Chuang Tzu, `Tao cannot be divided. To
divide Tao is to break the unity.' This is an extremely important
saying, which shows that the real Gnosis, the sanctifying and
redeeming Gnosis, cannot possibly be conveyed through the
display of goodness on its own, or through teaching on its own.
Tao can only be experienced in its completeness — or not at
all. That is why every human being needs to seek the way to
Tao, to find it and experience it himself.

We have seen that the personality is equipped with some
mighty abilities. All these abilities can only achieve their real
potential and will only be able to function in the proper way, if
they are applied in the correct combination, in cooperation with
the microcosm and the divine source at the centre of your
being. Virtue and knowledge must impel you to walk the path,
to practise the new approach to life. You must return to the
original nature, by following the enduristic path on which


```
HE WHOSE MOVEMENT IS GOOD WILL LEAVE NO TRACKS
```
your whole, nature-born self is sacrificed. That is the point we
have been trying to explain. It is the key to the whole meaning
of life.
The mistake human beings make is to think the mental and
moral endowments they possess — considerable though they
may be — are already fit for use and that by exerting them they
can spread blessings, knowledge, wisdom and progress in the
world around them; that in this way they will be able to serve
the Gnosis and humankind. But `Tao cannot be divided. To
divide Tao is to break the unity.'
That is why, if you really want to benefit from what is con-
veyed in the temples of the Rosycross, you will need to put the
new approach to life into practice. You will need to walk the
path yourself, right to the very end. If you do not do that, and
you nevertheless try to use your imagined abilities, you will
leave deep tracks behind you. You will sharpen the contrasts
between the antitheses and you will multiply evil.
If you recognise yourself as a `rich young man', a talented
person, you may, on hearing this, turn away in disappointment
and switch to a negative, dangerous approach to life in which
you no longer even try to do good. But you may also follow
the advice of Jesus the Lord `Leave all you have and follow
me,' fulfilling your task in profound obedience to the holy
work, to the Universal Chain and its emissaries. You need to
tear away from yourself the delusion of being perfect, the
delusion of thinking that `I can do everything, l can do it well,
l can do it myself.' You need to see your natural urges towards
virtue and knowledge in the proper light and adopt a life of
what the Bible calls `prayer and fasting'.
What does that mean Certainly not muttering prayers for
hours on end, and still less living on bread and water or going
without food for days, or performing rituals one after the


```
HE WHOSE MOVEMENT IS GOOD WILL LEAVE NO TRACKS
```
other. To the ancient sages, `prayer and fasting' meant focus-
ing one's whole state of life on the Other Realm, the Land of
the Father. It meant setting free the Kingdom within you and
bringing every action of your will into harmony with that aim.
It meant no longer listening with your ears to the cacophony
of the antitheses, but opening yourself, with your whole mind,
your whole head sanctuary, to the influx of the Seven-Spirit.
The ancient sages said `Leave the hearing of the ears to the
ears. Leave the work of the mind to the mind. When the soul is
still and without images, it will be open to receive. Into the
open soul, Tao' — the Seven-Spirit — `can descend.' That is
prayer and fasting.
If you walk your path in that way, if you live your pupil-
ship in that way, it will be possible to say of you, _He whose
movement is good will leave no tracks._ Then the microcosm
will move in the `hidden communion' with God. Spirit, soul
and body will be linked with each other in fulfilment of the
highest law of the divine nature. Only then will your abilities
be able to be applied as they were meant to be applied from
the beginning.
This is the only way in which you can free yourself, so as to
be able to use your freedom in the service of captive
humankind. Enter into the upper room, fasting — which means
persevering — and praying, focusing your whole being on that
single aim.

`When they had come into the town, they went to the upper
room, where they remained. All of them were together in
unity, persevering in prayer.' `When the day of Pentecost was
fulfilled, [...] they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.' The
outpouring of the Seven-Spirit had become a fact.
Only when that has happened will goodness, and the talents


```
HE WHOSE MOVEMENT IS GOOD WILL LEAVE NO TRACKS
```
of virtue and knowledge, no longer carve wounds in yourself
and others. For

_He whose movement is good will leave no tracks.
He whose speech is good will not give cause for blame.
He whose counting is good will need no tally.
He whose closing is good will need no bolts,
yet no man will be able to open what he has shut.
He whose binding is good will need no knots,
yet no man will be able to loosen what he has bound._



# 27 - iii

# He whose speech is good

# will not give cause for blame

In our discussion of chapter 27 of Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching we
have shown how the words, _he whose movement is good will
leave no tracks,_ can be fulfilled. All the talents, abilities and
attributes a nature-born person may have or which he might
be able to develop, can only be used in a liberating way for
himself and for others if he entrusts them to the living soul,
which means if he surrenders himself to the Gnosis on the
path of the endura and in this way opens his whole being to
the other nature. The microcosm and the personality then
become a unity.
The approach to life, the lifestyle, which proceeds from that,
is one which makes possible total withdrawal from the
alternation of antitheses. Death is completely overcome. The
undivided Tao, the Seven-Spirit, is manifested. And the per-
sonality who has thus focused itself on `that which is above',
will no longer leave tracks in `that which is below'. For such a
personality is in the world, but no longer of the world. That is
the mystery of Tao!
When you follow the `good path' and therefore no longer
leave behind any tracks, you will have withdrawn from all
reasons and causes for karma. When a person walks the good
path and meets the Other One - from within - he eliminates
the earth-binding results of his actions. That is the mystery of
what people call `the forgiveness of sins'. `Though your sins
be red as scarlet,' so the Bible says, `I will wash them whiter
than snow.'
This happens not through some external agency, as if by
divine intervention, but when you follow the good path and


```
HE WHOSE SPEECH IS GOOD WILL NOT GIVE CAUSE FOR BLAME
```
thereby enter into connection with the Immovable Kingdom,
for then you, yourself eliminate all the results of karma. You no
longer leave behind any tracks. You begin to rule over the
phenomena of dialectics and can therefore no longer be victi-
mised by them. In this way you will have eradicated the death-
causing elements of your way of life.
When someone practises goodness in the dialectical way,
thereby invoking and activating opposing forces and effects,
he will be bound to the results of his actions; he will not be
able to free himself from them. That is the primary reason
why human beings remain chained to the wheel of birth and
death; they leave behind karmic tracks in the nature of death.
Only when a human being's movement - his approach to life -
is good in the sense meant by gnostic magic will he no longer
leave any tracks and therefore free himself from the nature of
death. Then, for the first time, he will be absolutely free of the
earth-earthly and therefore able to work in the right way on
earth, in the service of his fellow human beings. And, as is
described in so many stories and legends about the sages of old,
a light-power will emanate from him which, alone, will be
sufficient to make a considerable difference to the world and
humankind.

We have spoken a good deal about the misery of dialectically
applied goodness. But we could say just as much about the
trouble caused by false or wrongful speech, or by the things
people say when they are under the influence of astral agi-
tation. What an aftermath a wrong spoken word can have,
even if, by the standards of goodness, it was very well-
meant. What causes for blame are so often involved in
human speech.
But the speech of those who walk the path of the Gnosis will
invariably be good and give no cause for blame, with all


```
HE WHOSE SPEECH IS GOOD WILL NOT GIVE CAUSE FOR BLAME
```
its karmic and hence earth-binding results. Their
counting, their closing, their opening and their binding
will also be good. They will have no need of aids, bars,
keys or cords. In other words in all their actions on the
path of sacrifice for humanity they will always take the
right measures and the right decisions. They will open up
whatever is needed to serve the holy work and they will
bind and close anything that could threaten the great aim.
Therefore, everything, yes, everything is dependent on
adopting the right path, the liberating approach to life. If
your movement is, in this sense, genuinely `good', you
will hold the key to gnostic magic firmly in your hand.
Imagine how it would be if a group of brothers and sisters
were to liberate this age-old magic of life in our midst.
What a glory would be unleashed! Did you think they
would need to discuss things for hours and days so as to
be able to take the appropriate measures and the correct
decisions, or to decide on the right way to understand
things No, these things would simply `be' there, the
instant their thoughts were directed towards some
particular need. Everything would fall into place, as soon
as the need arose.
A miracle Absolutely not! Only the result of the
liberating approach to life, which was forgotten so long ago.
It is the result of living in Tao. That is why it is said that

_The sage always excels in caring for people and rejects
no one._


# 27 - iv

## 27— IV The sage always excels in caring for people

```
The first part of chapter 27 of Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching enabled
us to see the contrast between the tragedy of dialectical good-
ness and the joys of the absolute good attained through the new
state of life. The text continues as follows
```
```
That is why the sage always excels in caring for people and
rejects no one. He always excels in caring for things and rejects
nothing. I call this being doubly enlightened.
```
```
To understand these words it is necessary to know what Lao
Tzu means by the word `sage'. The sage is a person who has
entered the original life, the heaven-earth, who has again
become a true Man, in the fullest, original sense of the word,
which was Manas — Thinker.
In the ordinary nature a thinker is a philosopher, a person
who uses his intellect to make observations and collect data,
and on that basis formulates a range of hypotheses, for instance
about the origin or meaning of life, or about God, the universe,
and so on.
You are probably familiar with many such products of
philosophical thought, formulated by nature-born egos. But
this kind of thought never goes further than the seeking
phase. It is largely speculation. There have been many clever
thinkers. There still are, and many more, no doubt, are yet to
come. Many of them write thick books about their theories,
and their ideas help countless seeking people to go further in
their search. In this way, the mental capacities of many
people are trained — albeit in a purely intellectual sense —
```

```
THE SAGE ALWAYS EXCELS IN CARING FOR PEOPLE
```
and the result is that, ultimately, they realise they are lacking
some fundamental, missing link.
In the beginning, logically enough, the seeker thinks it is
simply a problem of not knowing enough as yet; he thinks his
cerebral apparatus just needs to be trained more, that he must
accumulate still more facts. At long last, however, the
awareness will dawn on him that the deficiency lies not so
much in what he is capable of knowing, as in what he is
capable of doing. The mental apparatus of the brain is meant
to be an instrument of the thinking faculty. But the real think-
ing faculty itself is of quite another nature and essence. It is
meant to be the fourth vehicle of the human personality, but it
is only in an embryonic state in nature-born human beings.
And it will remain so as long as the human being remains in
his nature-born state.
It is very important to realise this, because there is an
immeasurable difference between intellectuality and wisdom.
Intellectual knowledge may sometimes be useful to the
nature-born person, but it has no value at all as a means of
penetrating to the great reality.
You may find this somewhat unacceptable, but we hope
you will try to understand it. People who are intellectually
trained and whose heads are full of intellectual knowledge,
are not interested in the wisdom of the new life, which only
arouses in them a feeling of mild contempt or the inclination
to laugh. The sage, however, regards the purely intellectual
approach as a dangerous course which leads only to delusion.
The intellectual approach does not give access to wisdom's
inner depths, nor even to its first glimmerings.
Nevertheless, the sage recognises the value underlying the
human mind and knows its real significance. The real, divinely
intended fourth vehicle, the cognitive faculty, com-


```
THE SAGE ALWAYS EXCELS IN CARING FOR PEOPLE
```
pletes the personality-system and turns it into a magical
instrument, all-knowing, all-providing. It is the living
soul. However, if _that_ vehicle were to be given to
humanity as it is manifested now, the resulting human
misery and sorrow would be incalculable. Imagine
everyone equipped with those creative powers and
abilities. It would be one great, horrible mess.
That is why the birth of the real mental vehicle does not
lie on this side of the dividing line, but on the other side.
The cognitive faculty can only be developed when the
pupil has attained soul-birth, and then leads his nature-
born personality across the dividing line with that soul-
state and under its guidance.

```
From the earth-earthly,
through the red sea of the
blood-passions, into the heaven-
earth, the promised land.
```
Only someone who has crossed that border can develop the
cognitive faculty. Then he will have access to wisdom and
will be able to use the cognitive faculty in the right way.
If you cannot yet enter the new land, then, even as a
pupil of the Spiritual School, you have only your nature-
born goodness and your nature-born mentality. But you
do have this, thanks be to God, that through the growing
rose in your heart you may hear the glorious call sent out
to you from the other shore. Then, perhaps, you will
understand what it really means to be wise and who, in
reality, can be called a sage.
In the next chapter, we would like to consider what the
sage is called to do, and what he is capable of doing.


# 27 - v

## 27— V Being doubly enlightened

```
That is why the sage always excels in caring for people and

```
```
After what we have been saying about chapter 27 you will be
able to understand these words, because you now know what
and who a sage is in the taoist sense. The sage is a person who,
having crossed the frontier of the order of time and space, has
entered the new life-field and become capable of functioning
in this heaven-earth. In that state of being, the cognitive faculty
is built up under the guidance of the living soul-state, in the
power of the Seven-Spirit.
The path to the `other shore' begins in this ordinary nature. It
starts with a personality which is entirely one with this nature,
since it is in this order of existence that the personality is
conscious. This personality discovers that it exists in a nature of
death, which is governed by the law of antitheses. It discovers
that the values, powers and abilities it possesses are not
absolute; they are constantly turning into their opposites.
When, as a result of all this experience, the personality-being
realises that all his troubles are fruitless, that everything comes
and goes, and all kinds of questions begin to come up in his
mind, the voice of the rose can awaken in his heart. The nuclear
principle of the microcosm can begin to speak, urging him to
undertake the journey to the true life, to seek the Land on the
other shore. Knowing that not a single one of his abilities is
absolute, the individual becomes aware that his inner being
does not yet measure up to a number of fundamental
requirements, and he begins to `make his paths straight' in the
```

```
BEING DOUBLY ENLIGHTENED
```
desert, in the chaotic desolation of his personal state of being.
He descends right down into the deepest depths of his being,
and in this way the soul is born.
What is the soul The soul is an organised concentration of
gnostic light-power, of the astral substance of the true life-
state. These light-forces enter the personality-system,
accumulate in the etheric double and shine in the darkness of
the individual's life. They give nourishment, food and drink
to the person who is engaged in making straight his paths.
This soul-state is a wonderful possession. It shines, as we
said, in the darkness, as well as giving food and alleviating
thirst.
But as the soul-light grows, the human being is also per-
mitted to behold a glimpse of the `other shore'. The vision
becomes increasingly clear, the path increasingly straight.
And in this way it becomes less and less necessary for the I
of nature to try frantically to make the best of things and
arrive at a solution, and more and more possible for the soul-
consciousness to take the lead in the individual's life and
guide it consciously to the nadir.
The individual's course of development then undergoes a
qualitative change. Previously, the direction of the path that had
to be made straight was quite unknown. It was obscured by all
kinds of obstacles. But all these obstacles must yield in the light
of the soul. Nothing can withstand it.
In this way, the soul-born person approaches the other shore
— behind him the darkness, before him the light of a new
dawn. While he is diving into the water so as to pass through
it to the other shore, or perhaps while he is laboriously scaling
the opposite bank, the heavens break open and the dove
descends upon him. The spirit descends upon him, the
Sephiroth, the Holy Spirit, and straight away the cognitive


```
BEING DOUBLY ENLIGHTENED
```
faculty is born. The cognitive faculty — the synthesis of the
spirit, the soul and the personality. The soul is the emissary of
the fire, the spirit is the fire itself. This is what we call _being
doubly enlightened._
Once in this state of being, the sage will always excel in
caring for people and will never reject anyone. For he works
not only with the goodness innate in him, purified by suffer-
ing, but also with the light of love of the truly living soul and
with the fire-power of the all-encompassing holy, healing
spirit. That is what the ancients meant by _being doubly
enlightened._

Now that we know this, we can glimpse something of the
work of the Universal Chain and its many servants, who return
from the other shore to the lands of darkness. Does that mean
a return to all the former dangers Absolutely not! For the
sage who has reached this state of twofold enlightenment of
spirit and soul has entered a reality which is omnipresent,
beyond time and space. Such a person can remain in that rea-
lity, wherever he may be. He exists in the inviolable.
We do not want you to understand this in the three-dimen-
sional, time-spatial sense, for instance in the way you under-
stand the separation between white and black, or between the
perfect and the imperfect, but in terms of the deepest
significance of the words `In the world but not of the world.'
The sage can move anywhere in the world, without iden-
tifying with its phenomena and thereby sustaining harm. And
the sage _will_ do that because all God's creatures must be led to a
good end, to their goal, to their destiny. That is why any
creature that has already been liberated has a task to fulfil with
respect to all those who are not. Any creation which is
manifesting in full glory will always be used to help and serve


```
BEING DOUBLY ENLIGHTENED
```
creations which are still in the process of development. That
is why nothing and no-one can escape the care and attention
of the sages.
If we try to view this mighty work from above, we see
countless creatures in manifestation in countless domains
of the All-Manifestation, all of them in widely differing
stages of development. We also see the enormous
hierarchy of liberated beings and sages, adapting
themselves to the developmental stages and the nature
and essence of all those countless beings, so as to stand
by them and be of service to them.
Must only `the good' be helped What is good No one is
good who still exists in the first phases of development not
even one!
Must the sages remain aloof from the `bad' Why
should they Isn't so-called evil really only the product
of ignorance and weakness Aren't the appalling deeds
people commit very often motivated by forces beyond
their control It is these people, especially, who must be
helped, in the most highly intelligent way, carefully
adapted to their state of being. Surely all need to come
home to the House of the Father
That is why the sage does not reward evil with lenience,
as humanists are inclined to do, but with the wisdom
which flows from the one plan which lies at the
foundation of the All. So the sage is not the judge, but the
teacher of the bad. All the behaviour of those who deviate
from the plan and thereby create the most awful
situations, is studied closely. Then they can be treated in
keeping with their state, so that the plan, which also lies
at the foundation of their being, will one day succeed. It is
in this sense that the bad is the teacher of the good.

# He who attaches no value to power

# has attained supreme wisdom

We have now come to the last verse of chapter 27 of the Tao Te
Ching

_Though his wisdom may seem foolish, he who attaches no value
to power and does not seek affluence has attained supreme
wisdom._

This verse brings us up against a difficulty, because virtually
all Chinese scholars give different translations of it. Most of
them simply explain that the Chinese text is very obscure at
this point. So although we will be trying to give you an
explanation, we are not certain that it will be in keeping with
the original text.

Throughout all times, liberated entities have carried out their
task with respect to those creatures still on the path or still
wandering in darkness. This means that there has always been
contact between those who have been born as to the spirit, and
those who are as yet unborn. The quality of this contact is very
important for both parties. Is there sympathy, or is there
antipathy Are the workers met with belief or with disbelief Is
there susceptibility to real help Or not
These are urgent questions. Remember, for instance, the
words of Matthew chapter 13 `They took offence at him. But
Jesus said to them A prophet is not without honour except in
his own country and in his own house. And He did not do many
mighty works there, because of their unbelief.' So the contact
between those who are born and those who are unborn can
involve many difficulties.


### has attained supreme wisdom 27— VI He who attaches no value to power

That is why Lao Tzu alerts his pupils to this at the end of
chapter 27, because tendencies towards misconception, dis-
belief and even opposition and resistance, are always liable to
come to the surface owing to the fact that the help and power
emanating from the sages can have only one goal. Moreover, it
is a help which is given impersonally and thus goes out to good
and bad alike.
Doesn't the fundamental, life-encompassing requirement set
by the School frequently conflict with your personal
interests and circumstances All who approach the new life
will, in one way or another, have to let go of something. They
will have to introduce changes in their approach to life and do
things they would much rather not do.
That is why those who still expect everything of the hori-
zontal level will experience a considerable amount of conflict
on seeking and gaining contact with the sages, because,
owing to their state of being, the sages are unable to compro-
mise even slightly. In most cases this conflict will be
unintentional, and certainly not desired by the pupil.
Why does it happen Because every nature-born human
being exists in a state of imprisonment. All are the prisoners
of the astral field in which they live, for it controls their entire
personality. In this astral field many radiation-forces are
found. Some originate from the individual's past, or from the
collective past of humanity. Others originate from
humanity's present state of life. And there is a third kind of
influence, which penetrates the world from the Immovable
Kingdom.
Owing to their astral quality, these vibrations from the
Immovable Kingdom can no longer reach human beings in a
direct way, and are therefore brought to them by the sages.
Obviously, this fundamental difference will quite naturally and
inevitably cause conflict. The flaming sword of the


```
HE WHO ATTACHES NO VALUE TO POWER
```
doubly illumined ones, the blazing sword of the Holy Grail, the
sword of the Apocalypse, strikes and pierces everyone.
That is the predicament of those who are imprisoned in
their astral bonds to such an extent that they can no longer
react harmoniously to the inviting call of the light. What an
intense conflict of conscience this must cause! Listening to
the voice, hearing the call, but still not being able to react!
When a day of manifestation is still in the process of
unfoldment and has not yet reached its nadir, humanity in
general notices little of this piercing astral conflict. There are
certainly contrasts between doctrine and life, but there are
plenty of ways of avoiding the consequences. However, when a
phase of human development is approaching its lawful end,
difficulties are exacerbated to such an extent that people are
held back by the bitter facts from escaping the great require-
ment. Then there is no choice but to demonstrate positively
how one stands with respect to the messengers of the light.
When that point is reached, it becomes evident that neither
good, nor evil, nor the possession of great intellectual know-
ledge, can bring humanity a single step further on the path of
development. All the values people tried to cling to in their
desperation, have turned out to be empty, void. The human
urge towards goodness remains, but no one knows any longer
what is good and what is bad; what one person considers to be
good, another person denounces as the greatest evil. People can
no longer escape the conclusion that their lives have been
founded on delusion and that now, there is only one reality left,
the reality of the void. Hence the question How do you stand
with respect to the messengers of the light, and the wisdom of
the light
A Spiritual School is always manifested at the end of a
cultural period. The awakening call which emanates from it
forces everyone to react. The sword is struck right into the


```
HE WHO ATTACHES NO VALUE TO POWER
```
deepest depths of the human soul, aiming to make
contact with the primordial atom of the heart and impel
it to positive activity. The result of this can never be
evil. For it is caused by the Only Good, which comes
from the Father of Lights and seeks to form a link with
everything and everyone who is in danger of being lost.
This message, this warning, had to be given to
you. Let your consciousness dwell on the final
words of chapter 27 of the Tao Te Ching although
his approach to life may be decried by everyone as
the greatest foolishness, the one who no longer
attaches any value to dialectical forces and does not
want to drown in the delusion of the nature of death,
has gained connection with the supreme wisdom.


_He is the valley of the kingdom who knows his masculine strength,
yet retains feminine gentleness._

_Being the valley of the kingdom, the everlasting virtue will not
leave him; he will be restored to the unaffected, uncomplicated
state of a child._

_He who knows his own light, yet remains in the shadow, is an
example for the kingdom._

_Being an example for the kingdom, the everlasting virtue will not
fail him and he will return to the infinite._

_He who knows his own glory, yet remains in shame, is the valley
of the kingdom._

_Being the valley of the kingdom, the everlasting virtue will
attain perfection in him and he will return to the original
state._

_When the original state of simplicity was extended, things were
formed._

_Making use of these things, the sage will be the natural leader of
the workers._

_Offending no-one, he will govern to the benefit of all._

Tao Te Ching chapter 28
```

# 28 - I

## 28— I The valley of the kingdom

```
When the Bible says man was created in God's image and
likeness, one should not make the mistake of thinking that this
refers to the nature-born personality. The real, divine human
being is the microcosm, the monad, and the personality is its
instrument, through which the monad's essence, aim and task
are approached, known and accomplished.
So when you hear it said that the human being is a self-
creating entity whose task is self-realisation, you need to
bear in mind that the human manifestation needs to be under-
stood in a new way, quite different from the ordinary. The
two forms of human manifestation, man and woman, are
fundamentally different, and this fact has brought humanity a
great deal of sorrow and confusion on its course through the
nadir, as well as reinforcing the ties which bind it to this
nature-order.
From the very beginning of its course through the nadir
humankind understood that there should be full cooperation
between the sexes. But just what this cooperation really
means, how it is practised and what its purpose is, have
always been interpreted in a variety of ways. And a real,
highly attuned cooperation between the sexes has, in fact,
never been achieved in the nadir, because the underlying
principles have never been fully understood. That is why there
have been periods during which men subjugated women, and
other periods during which women subjugated men, to say
nothing of their other moral interrelationships. In ancient
Egypt there was a time when the man had to promise
obedience to the woman, and this requirement was formalised
```

```
THE VALLEY OF THE KINGDOM
```
in the marriage contract. Later on, in the marriage contract
formulated by the church, these roles were reversed.
In magic, cooperation between men and women as equals
has always been a matter of course, and in gnostic magic it is
a sine qua non, for in reality, nothing good or liberating can
be achieved if this cooperation is not functioning faultlessly.
While not wishing to deviate from our subject, this important
principle of cooperation had to be mentioned here to show
the nature of humanity's bondage and terror in the nadir. For
this whole disastrous development was caused by ignorance
of the true significance of the dual forces at work in human
nature.
Two forces, two currents emanate from the monad, from
the microcosm. These two currents are equal in value and
significance. In relation to each other, one is positive and the
other negative in the ordinary sense of the word. However, in
human monads, these two currents are polarised differently.
So it could be said that there are two groups of human
monads. In one group, it is the first monadic current which is
positively polarised, while in the other group it is the second.
So the two groups, although equal, are sharply to be distin-
guished. To convey this idea of equality in dissimilarity we
use the term `inversely proportional', hence the expression,
`inversely proportional polarisation'. You will never find this
expression in a dictionary, because as a concept it is
unknown. If it were known, the world today would no doubt
look quite different!
As well as being divided into these two streams, human
monads are further divided into seven groups, distinguished
by the nature of their radiations but at the same time absolu-
tely equal. But we will not discuss this any further at the
moment, to avoid confusion of ideas.
One of the results of the inversely proportional polarisation


```
THE VALLEY OF THE KINGDOM
```
of the two monadic currents is that there are two kinds of form
which the monad may take on in order to express itself on the
various planes of manifestation. These are the male and the
female. In the male form, masculine strength predominates as
the positive pole, while in the female form, feminine gentleness
predominates as the positive pole.
To prevent misunderstanding we first need to seek an
explanation of what the Tao means when it uses the words
`masculine strength' and `feminine gentleness', for we are
aware that the world has its own ideas about these things.
In gnostic philosophy, when the word `strength' is used, it
is referring to the monad's causative power. The monad pos-
sesses a mighty power, a whole series of mighty faculties
with the help of which the great, divine plan must be carried
out.
The term `gentleness' or `meekness' refers to the essence of
the monadic being. This is what it means, for instance, when
Jesus says `Learn from me, that I am meek'. It means the
meekness — the gentle courage — of divine love. `Blessed are
the meek, for they shall inherit the earth,' as it says in the
Sermon on the Mount.
So the divine essence is inherent in the monad in a twofold
way as the divine causative power, and as divine love; as
masculine strength and as feminine gentleness. Because of the
inversely proportional polarisation, one aspect of the divine
essence — causative power — is epitomised by the original,
prototypical man, while the other aspect — love — is
epitomised by the prototypical woman. Of course this does not
mean to say that the opposite pole of the monad is not also
present in each prototype.
If you see the situation in a higher context, rising above what
you know of the present form, character and behaviour of the
two sexes in the nature of death and all the resultant difficulties


```
THE VALLEY OF THE KINGDOM
```
and problems present in human life, you will realise that, in
the life-sphere of each individual entity, self-realisation is a
matter of course. For the two monadic currents needed for
this self-realisation — the divine power of causation, and the
divine nature of love — are both present in every human
form. It is equally clear, though, that the way in which this
self-realisation process unfolds in each of the sexes will be
different, because of the opposite way in which the two
different types of monad are polarised. But the results will
be the same.
There wouldn't be any point in trying to describe the ideal
woman or the ideal man. They simply do not exist in this
three-dimensional nadir! Our aim is only to convey the
understanding given in the Tao of how every monad will be
able to attain an ideal personality-instrumentarium and how,
through the efforts of these perfect instruments, the realms of
earth and heaven-earth will once more be rendered capable of
fulfilling their divine purpose.
Let us not forget, here, the biblical statement that inhabitants
of the kingdom of heaven neither marry nor are given in
marriage. Matrimony is an expedient made necessary by life in
the nadir. It is accepted by the Gnosis, but is not essential to the
liberating life itself.
What is essential is the spontaneous cooperation between
the two types of monad, in all domains of matter and spirit.
Let us not banalise this mighty fact, and state only that all
gnostic brotherhoods in the course of the ages have pro-
claimed conceptions of this which differed widely from
those of the majority of human beings. The incomprehen-
sion and slander with which these conceptions and ways of
behaving were met was often used by the adversary to their
detriment.


```
THE VALLEY OF THE KINGDOM
```
The ground is now prepared for gaining an understanding of
chapter 28 of the Tao Te Ching _He is the valley of the kingdom
who knows his masculine strength, yet retains feminine
gentleness._ We would also like to invert these words, and say
she is the valley of the kingdom who knows feminine gentle-
ness, yet applies masculine strength.
There is a power of causation, and a divine love-radiation.
Both of these emanate from the monad. And you will know
the words of I Corinthians, Chapter 13 `If I have everything
but have not love, I have nothing and am nothing.' So the
monadic current of love is the greater of the two, for without
this inner essence of the monad, the causative power could
never develop. This divine power is revealed through divine
love, and in this way the two monadic currents combine to
form a unity. From this unity the tri-unity of the divine
sonship becomes a reality. So if you are able to activate the
two monadic currents within the personality, the childship of
God will be born in you in reality.
The `valley of the kingdom' is an ancient Chinese repre-
sentation of a place where genuine alchemical work is done.
Just as human dwellings are found in valleys because of the
fertile land they contain, so a genuine pupil will enter `the
valley', the place where the Brotherhood lives and works,
when he sets out to bring into manifestation and harmonious
cooperation the two monadic currents present within him the
power of causation, combined with the greatest gentleness.
Only on this basis can there be unity and cooperation be-
tween those whose personality-forms differ because of their
inversely proportional polarisation.


### 28 - II

### The everlasting virtue

In the preceding chapter we began discussing chapter 28 of
the Tao Te Ching, whose first verse reads as follows

_He is the valley of the kingdom who knows his masculine
strength, yet retains feminine gentleness._

We mentioned that the words, `valley of the kingdom' repre-
sent being admitted to and participating in the Brotherhood
of Life, the community of the living soul-state. All who are
engaged in enabling the two monadic currents — the power
of causation and the power of gentleness — to cooperate in
the right way, are called to belong to this community.
If these two powers really are manifesting harmoniously
and cooperatively in the nature-born human being, they bring
about a complete transformation of that person's life-state.
All the challenges that accompany the practice of pupilship
then no longer present obstacles. The pupil enters a state of
inner calm, a serenity which lifts him above his nature-born
state. Transfiguration will then begin, and he or she will be
fitted for participation in the group of those who are of the
same mind, and of the same kindred.
The new state of being entered by such people when they
begin to live and work through the two monadic currents, the
twofold power of the rose, is what the Tao calls _the everlasting
virtue._ Hence the words

_Being the valley of the kingdom, the everlasting virtue will not
leave him; he will be restored to the unaffected, uncomplicated
state of a child._


```
THE EVERLASTING VIRTUE
```
The two monadic currents which are set free and made active in
the candidate make him fit to walk the path of liberation. From
that moment onwards he possesses an ability which he can
apply in practice to lift himself above the nature of death,
above the experience of life in the nadir. This ability — virtue
— will enable him, step by step, to enter the new nature and
join the arc of evolution. He has become a child of God again.
The Bible has much to say about this extraordinary virtue
of the childship of God. When the two monadic currents
present in the human heart combine and the light of the rose
can be perceived, the childship, the spirit of the sonship, is
born. When a person reforms his approach to life in the right
way, then the results will prove — or, as John says, the spirit
will testify — that he has become a child of God. A child
who is brought up in the right way is guided towards his
destiny. Similarly, the pupil who is born into the childship of
God and has joined the arc of evolution, and is therefore
equipped with the everlasting virtue, will walk his path
upward in the right ways
All this is connected with a task which, particularly in
the beginning, is not fully understood by those who are
preparing themselves for the path. That is why Lao Tzu
gives his pupils further instruction on this point, telling
them that it is necessary for the candidate in the gnostic
mysteries to remain `in the shadow' and `in shame'. That
sounds rather strange, and needs to be understood in the
right way.
Someone who has succeeded in enabling the two monadic
currents — masculine strength and feminine gentleness, the
power of causation and divine love — to be expressed har-
moniously in the personality will inevitably experience the
inner compulsion to serve, help and be an example to his
fellow human beings who are still living at the bottom of


```
THE EVERLASTING VIRTUE
```
the nadir-pit, in ignorance and confusion. That is the meaning
of the words _He who knows his own light, yet remains in the
shadow, is an example for the kingdom._ A brother or sister
who bears the signature of the everlasting virtue will spon-
taneously enlist in the ranks of the serving Brotherhood.
Perhaps it would be a good thing to underline, here, the
words our text takes as its starting point — the signature _He
who knows his own light._ This refers to the human being who
has activated within himself the two monadic currents as a
twofold power of the rose, so that, in the light of the other
kingdom, he can discern how things stand in the work-field
which is in the shadow.
Those who live and work through these two monadic cur-
rents will also cooperate in the way necessitated by the fact of
inversely proportional polarisation. It is precisely this
cooperation which will make those involved invincible,
because the two divine currents will both be expressed with
equal positivity, without burning each other. This is a result
which can only be attained through cooperation, provided —
remember — that the cooperating group has entered the state of
the everlasting virtue. So, although the liberated human being
has become capable of autonomous creation and realisation, he
or she will always seek, find and practise cooperation, and thus
group unity.
So one can always tell from a worker's habitual behaviour
and the signature it conveys whether his point of departure lies
on the light-side of life or on the shadow-side. Those who
reject this kind of cooperation, or accede to it only in theory but
not in practice, and, when it comes to it, follow rules that serve
their own ego rather than ones that serve the principles of
cooperation, are still behaving in a way which typifies the
human being of the nadir. People who are approaching the


```
THE EVERLASTING VIRTUE
```
end of their path through the nadir, but have not yet found the
everlasting virtue, do tend to behave like this. They pursue
their innate urges towards goodness and achievement, but
without letting go of their I-centrality, and this only succeeds
in accelerating the alternation of opposites. Particularly in a
School like ours, such I-central effort constitutes a perpetual
source of difficulties, tensions and delay.
What kind of people approach our School Usually, they
are people whose experience of the hopelessness of the
nature of death has made them receptive to the Universal
Doctrine. The Universal Doctrine touches them, and
afterwards they go through all the stages of dialectical
confusion — because the lid has been removed from the pit
and rays of light are boring their way into the darkness —
whilst at the same time they are the offspring of parents who
have also suffered in the labyrinth of the land of shadows.
In all of them there is an impulse towards goodness and a
certain willpower, as very faint reflex reactions to the two
monadic currents. In addition, they naturally have certain
talents one person might have the ability to organise, another
might be able to speak fluently, while another might be good
at writing, and so on.
From this so varied group of those who are struggling at
the bottom of the pit of death, having seen a faint glimmer of
the light, the workers are chosen who are to be involved in
work for the School — not because they know the light, but
because they seek the light, and are therefore given the
opportunity to find it, and enter the everlasting virtue,
through the experiences and suffering that doing the work
will bring. That is why the School is a Spiritual School.
And all who are asked to fulfil tasks as workers are told
about group unity and its requirements, set by the holy law
and, in obedience, yearning and understanding, they join


```
THE EVERLASTING VIRTUE
```
in that group unity and cooperation quite spontaneously. In
this way, a community of friends comes into being. For
friendship, too, is a reflex reaction to the monadic currents.
And that is how, through gnostic work, which has to be built
from the lowest level upwards, a group is formed that does
not yet possess the light, but only tries to do so, full of
sincerity and devotion. They do not yet know their own light;
their sun has not yet risen. But the radiant light of the Living
Body illuminates them unto this rebirth.

Now such a team of workers only needs to have a few
members who are overshadowed by adversarial forces — and
physical and psychological degenerations offer plenty of
scope for that — and straight away delaying actions will
arise, as well as serious danger to the progress of the School's
work. Yes, sometimes even the very existence of the School
is threatened. Why Well, you know the requirements of
group unity. The monadic reflexes of goodness are active in
you. The adversary knows how you are likely to think and act
during this phase in your life. Carried away by your love for
your fellow group members, you will not realise the need to
take an objective distance from your relationship with them,
and you will not even see the danger this presents. Yet this
love is not the real love, but its monadic reflex in your
nature-born state. This reflex reaction in your unborn state is
mistaken for love. Thus the way is paved for a fatal delay.
The help of divine love, which must be given to all who
deviate from the path, is a rectifying, correcting help, the kind of
help that will prevent the other person from causing harm. This
help has to protect the Spiritual School above all, as the first
priority, because the School is the means, the instrument,
through which those who participate in the everlasting virtue
approach those who still dwell in shadow and shame. The


```
THE EVERLASTING VIRTUE
```
School is also the place in which people are enabled to carry
out the work of developing the everlasting virtue. If these two
aspects of the Spiritual School are clearly understood, all kinds
of misunderstandings can be avoided. For to lose the School
means to lose everything.
So that is why, throughout all the years of its existence, the
Spiritual School has been working on the formation of a
special group within the group at large. From the outset it was
decided that it would be this special group that, starting from
first principles, would enter the valley of the kingdom and
possess the everlasting virtue.
The Community of the Golden Head, with its thirty-two
members, constitutes this special group, which is intended to
guide the inner work and therefore to form the governing head
of the Living Body of the School.
In addition, there is the Sixth Aspect of our Spiritual School,
which has been active for a number of years. The work
performed in this group cannot be done by nature-born means,
but only through higher faculties. This task is carried out for
the benefit of everyone in the Spiritual School.
Thirdly, we have a group which, through Grail magic, is
urged towards an inner life that will ultimately lead to
conscious participation in the divine soul-life.
It would take us too far from our subject to go any further
into these things at the moment, but one thing at least should be
clear by now these groups could not fulfil their task if their
basis were in the land of shadow and shame, but only if their
basis is in the land of the truly living. So now we can under-
stand Lao Tzu's words

_He who knows his own light, yet remains in the shadow, is an
example for the kingdom. Being an example for the kingdom,_


```
THE EVERLASTING VIRTUE
```
_the everlasting virtue will not fail him and he will return to the
infinite. He who knows his own glory, yet remains in shame, is
the valley of the kingdom._

In the next chapter we will tell you more about the path of
sacrifice followed by those in whom the powers of the two
monadic currents are fully active.


```
THE SAGE WILL BE THE LEADER OF THE WORKERS
```
the workers in God's vineyard will be the restoration and res-
cue of all those who are lost, and they will do this in the power
of the divine love with which they have become united.
Having come to this point, Lao Tzu makes clear to his
pupils that the sacrifice made by the liberated ones for the
benefit of those who are not yet liberated should not be
understood in a negative sense. Seen from the viewpoint of
the nature of death, someone who sacrifices himself is a
`man of sorrows', just as Jesus the Lord was called `the
man of sorrows'. But the sacrifice we are talking about is
just a matter of logic. It means a straight passage, a direct
ascent towards the one goal. That is why Lao Tzu says

_Being an example for the kingdom, the everlasting virtue will
not fail him and he will return to the infinite._

For people who are still bound to three-dimensionality there
is a sharp distinction between `above' and `below'. But for
someone who knows his or her own light, `above' and `below'
are the same. Through what is `below', he goes to what is
`above'. In other words, this logical sacrifice is a path of joy,
the open gateway to the infinite. Someone who is completely
imprisoned in the nature of death experiences sacrifice not as
a matter of course but as a terrible pain which he tries to
avoid as far as possible. That is why all who are approaching
the Universal Gnosis should change not only the way they
approach life, but also the way they perceive it. The result
will be that, very often, sorrow will turn into joy, the reality
of death will turn into life, and difficulties and grief will turn
into profound gladness, without there actually having been
any change in external circumstances.
Some people are so accustomed to seeing certain situations
in their lives as burdensome, difficult, unpleasant and terrible,
that this becomes quite firmly rooted in their mentality, and


```
THE SAGE WILL BE THE LEADER OF THE WORKERS
```
they are dominated by the resultant thought-images to
such an extent that they are no longer able to change
the way they perceive, even though they may have
enough new soul-quality to do so. They do not use
their imperishable treasure. If they were able to break
through to a new way of perceiving, they would
immediately know that they had passed through the
gateway and they would understand the real meaning
of their outer circumstances. That is why Lao Tzu says

_He who knows his own glory, yet remains in shame, is
the valley of the kingdom. Being the valley of the
kingdom, the everlasting virtue will attain perfection in
him and he will return to the original state._

Finally, we need to look at the following words _When
the original state of simplicity was extended, things
were formed._
In the original nadir-state of humankind, when the
school of life in matter had not yet fallen into sin, all
the things, all the values, all the material forms
necessary for life in that training school were brought
into existence. All these original things, values and
forces are still available even now, for when the
`original state of simplicity' was extended, these
things were fashioned indestructibly. And the sage,
the liberated human being, will find and recognise
them, and accept them with joy and gratitude, so that
he can harness and apply them once more. That is
why Lao Tzu says

_Making use of these things, the sage will be the natural
leader of the workers. Neither harming nor offending
anyone, he will govern to the benefit of all._


# 29 - 1

## 29— I The holy, sacrificial vessel

```
The issues dealt with in chapter 29 of the Tao Te Ching have
always been so badly misunderstood. If only people had
realised the meaning of Lao Tzu's living words, how different
the world would look today!
Open and honest, straightforward and direct, Lao Tzu pre-
sented truth and reality to his disciples in just a few sober
phrases. Yet now, it will take quite a lengthy explanation to
convey to you just something of what he meant. The reason
for this lies in the fact that, for ages past, the world and
humankind have been developing in a direction which
deviates totally from the essential, and now things have set,
crystallised, in that wrong direction. Humanity is so
thoroughly entangled in the labyrinth of earthy misery — the
world has become such an absolute hell — that if we were to
say, like Lao Tzu, that the kingdom — the world — is a
sacrificial vessel, on which one may not work, your first
reaction would most likely be one of breathless astonishment,
followed by indignant protestation, and then maybe derisive
laughter at such foolish naivety.
The holy vessel has become a dunghill! Immense astral
dangers are accumulating around the world, and it is only a
matter of time before they are discharged into the holy vessel.
How should we understand these things
Well, first you need to form a clear conception of `the
kingdom'. Do not think of some Chinese empire or ancient
principality, or of instructions for rulers, ministers or other
authority figures. The kingdom is, firstly, the earth, a mani-
festing planet, the kingdom in which the form-aspect of the
```

```
THE HOLY, SACRIFICIAL VESSEL
```
human personality must be manifested. The kingdom is also
the heaven-earth, the true, divine habitation, given by God as
a dwelling place for the real human being, who consists of a
spirit, a soul and a body. So the earth-earthly and the heaven-
earth should be seen as two-in-one, inseparably connected
with each other and forming, together, `the kingdom'.
Now that is what the `holy sacrificial vessel' is a space
prepared and maintained by the Logos in which a glorious
divine process must be carried out, in keeping with the origi-
nal decision `Let us make man in our image and likeness'.
And did you think for one moment that this original divine
decision would not be carried out Many mighty forces, many
lifewaves different from ours, are involved in this mighty
labour, aiding the development of the monads who are called
to become true human beings.
This assistance is a service, offered in sacrifice. It has been
going on for an unimaginably long time, and will continue to go
on until the great plan has been carried right through to its
crowning victory in the holy sacrificial vessel. The Lords of
Fate, the Lords of Compassion, the many hosts of angels and
countless other sublime beings together form the multitude of
servants who are offering themselves in sacrifice. And all are
linked together to form one mighty whole, known as `the ever-
living fig tree. The great sacrifice of the ever-living fig tree,
offered in the holy, sacrificial vessel, will never cease until all
the monads called to become true human beings have entered
that sublime state.
We tend to think we are already `human beings'. We call
ourselves `human', and `humankind', but we are not, not yet.

THE HOLY, SACRIFICIAL VESSEL
```
This delusion has been inculcated in us by theology and dis-
tortion of the original truth. And that is why it will be helpful
to have the following overview of the whole course of human
development.
The holy sacrificial vessel, the planetary two-in-one, has
passed through many periods of preparation, corresponding
to the various phases in the development of the monadic
human being. To convey an idea of this whole process of
involution, existence in the nadir, and evolution, which is
necessary to complete the holy, sacrificial vessel, Rosicru-
cian teachings speak of seven globes, the seven forms of the
planetary two-in-one.
For the sake of convenience these globes are denoted by the
letters A, B, C, and so on. At the moment, we are living on
globe D, the globe of the nadir. Globe E, the fifth globe of the
series of seven, exists on a higher plane, on the evolutionary
side of the monadic human being's development, rather than on
the involutionary side. On each globe, seven developmental
phases take place, which in one sense are duplications of
developments on previous globes, and in another sense are
preparations for subsequent developments, on later manifes-
tations of the two-in-one.
So we live now, as we said, on globe D, the fourth one,
which is the globe of the nadir. On this globe, three develop-
mental phases lie behind us, during which the prehistoric past
was repeated, as it were. We are now in the fourth phase, the
Aryan epoch, during which the earth has already gone through
many secondary transformations. The Aryan epoch is a
decisive one, for during it the entire process of involution, of
the preparation of the form aspect of things, must be brought to
a conclusion, and the way needs to be paved for the inner side,
the core aspect, to be manifested. This will take place for the
first time during the three remaining epochs on globe D,


```
THE HOLY, SACRIFICIAL VESSEL
```
during which the entire future of humankind will have to be
manifested as a reality. After that will follow the mighty
developments on the next three globes E, F, and G.
With this cosmological image in mind, you should be able to
gain a clear impression of the nature of the holy, sacrificial
vessel. If you keep this clearly in mind, you will understand the
enormous scope of the plan underlying the development of the
divine monads called to become human beings. You will also
realise that this plan can never fail, because the sacrificial
vessel is sheltered by the ever-living fig tree.

`The plan underlying human genesis cannot fail.' We are
making this statement as if it were axiomatic, but really, is it
any more than a pious wish Isn't it rather unjustifiably
optimistic, in view of the real state of things here and now, in
the nadir Well, let's think about that.
There is no doubt that, in the present phase of the Aryan
epoch, human beings are in the throes of a great crisis, just as
they were in Lao Tzu's times. One of the causes of this crisis
is the fact that, due to I-centrality and ignorance, and the
resultant lack of genuinely liberating soul-power, humanity
is not willing to go beyond the point it has reached in the
nadir, and move on to the liberating ascent of the arc of
evolution. And nascent humanity cannot be forced into that,
because it needs to be done in unity, freedom and love, with
the help of a newborn soul generated by the two monadic
currents discussed in the previous chapter.
If this new soul-state is lacking and three-dimensional
confusion blocks the memory of the monad, all further pro-
gress will be brought to a halt and the whole plan will be
threatened with collapse. Then everyone will be confronted
with the bitter experience of fighting and devouring each
other like savage animals, locked endlessly in a deadly, self-


```
THE HOLY, SACRIFICIAL VESSEL
```
destructive struggle, aided now and then by a cosmic revo-
lution. Is that a complete description of our present world
situation
No, a thousand times no! The critical phase we are again go-
ing through is the most eloquent proof that the ever-living fig
tree will never forsake humanity, and neither will it deviate
from the original plan to make `men in God's image, after His
likeness'. It also proves that the fundamental pre-requisite for
this remains self-realisation.
In fact, self-realisation is not only the prerequisite, but also
the natural, incontrovertible outcome. Natural laws are in-
herent in the sacrificial vessel, or the holy mixing vessel as
Hermes calls it, which offer the developing human being
only one way out the attainment of perfection and liberation
through self-realisation. To understand how these natural
laws work you need to take the following facets of the devel-
oping human being into consideration

firstly, there is a monad, or microcosm, connected with every
developing human being;
secondly, two currents of energy emanate from this monad, as
we discussed in the previous chapter. These two currents,
inversely proportional in polarisation, are known as male
strength and female gentleness;
thirdly, there is a monadic self or monadic ego (the
microcosm's consciousness), with a nucleus from which these
two currents emanate;
fourthly, through natural birth there will always be a per-
sonality, an instrument serving the monad;
fifthly, this personality possesses a natural consciousness, an I,
the nature-born ego;

Haarlem, The Netherlands, 1987, Chapter XXI, The Holy Mixing Vessel.


```
THE HOLY, SACRIFICIAL VESSEL
```
sixthly there is a karmic being, also called the karmic ego, the
astral self, the adversary, or the devil;
seventhly, these aspects of the developing human being,
working either in cooperation or in conflict with each other,
will ultimately ensure the total triumph of the divine plan.

In the next chapter, we hope to explain why this is so irrefu-
tably certain. If we succeed, you will be able to understand
chapter 29 of the Tao Te Ching completely.


### 29 - II

### The way to victory

Let us picture the holy mixing vessel we described in the
previous chapter, the sacrificial vessel of the two-in-one
the earth-earthly and the heaven-earth. In this holy mixing
vessel, the mighty, sacrificing power of the ever-living tree
is blended with the sixfold human system from which the
true human being will eventually arise. This sacrificing
power can also be referred to as the Universal Chain, with
its endless line of messengers and saviours such as Lao
Tzu, Hermes Trismegistus, the Buddha and Jesus Christ.
One could also simply call it God.
Clearly, every entity must have been in living contact with
this great, sacrificing stream in the holy, sacrificial vessel
ever since the very beginning of monadic development.
`Monad' means divine spark. What is of God imparts itself to
the monad. And if we use the words `monad' and
`microcosm' in one breath, it is because the microcosm is a
system which is formed around the monad through the
radiation of the divine spark. So, right from the beginning,
the divine spark must have been connected to the wonderful,
measureless divine power of the holy, sacrificial vessel.
Now this fact is and has always been experienced by every
entity belonging to the developmental system as a natural
law, as a systematic, universally present influence. This
influence transmits to the creature the plan, the idea
underlying creation. It is the spirit, which will make the
entity truly alive. This spirit remains the same eternally and
unchangeably. Now let us suppose, for the moment, that you
do not yet know anything about this divine plan, and you


```
THE WAY TO VICTORY
```
have not yet had any experience of it. Let us imagine that your
personality possesses no higher faculty with which you could
react consciously to this plan and hence cooperate with it. So
on the one hand, there is the monad, the divine spark with its
system, the microcosm, and on the other hand there is the
personality, still shrouded in ignorance and not yet able to react
in any conscious way.
Yet, despite this situation, you would nevertheless be
compelled to react. How can that happen, then It happens
by means of the mechanisms incorporated into your present
state of being, which were described in the last chapter.
There is a monad, a microcosm, which surrounds your per-
sonality. This microcosm possesses a nucleus, also called
the monadic self, and from that nucleus two currents
emanate. Obviously, the microcosm will react unreservedly
to the tremendous spiritual power which is offering itself for
that purpose in the field of manifestation. That is why we
speak of the `God in you'.
What matters now is that the personality thus encompassed
by the microcosm becomes a proper vehicle which can func-
tion in the service of the monad, in the service of the divine
power which is being offered. To enable it to fulfil this func-
tion, the personality possesses a whole series of potentialities,
innate within it since birth, and it has a twofold ego consisting
of an I-consciousness (the consciousness with which, for
instance, you are able to assimilate the contents of this book),
and a karmic ego, an astral self.
So this is how the process works the spirit of the mixing
vessel, the tremendous, divine power at work in the earth-
system, drives the monad into manifestation. It is the great
plan `Let us make men in our image and after our likeness'.
This plan is etched into the monad, which then radiates it
outwards and relays it to the personality. The monad tries to


```
THE WAY TO VICTORY
```
convey the suggestion, the idea of the plan to your conscious-
ness, your ego, and tries to make your ego into a supple, willing
and obedient instrument so that the entire personality-system
will be adapted to the plan.
But what if the ego does not react, because it either cannot or
will not In that case, it will be the karmic ego, the astral self,
that reacts. There are no exceptions to this. If an impulse from
the divine mixing vessel is sent to you via the monad, and your
I-consciousness refuses to react, then the astral self will always
react instead. Whenever the personality reacts in the wrong
way, whenever it thinks or does anything which is not in
harmony with that great, motive power, this is always
registered by the astral self.
Moreover, the karmic self can never die. When the perso-
nality dies and is dissolved, the karmic self continues to exist. It
survives death; it is immortal, and will become active again in
the next personality to be born in the microcosm. God be
praised! For if the karmic self were also to perish every time,
the same mistakes would be made all over again.
But as personality succeeds personality, the karmic self
becomes increasingly conscious and rich in experience. Since it
has come into being as a result of mistaken reactions to the
divine law, it is clear that, as soon as it has become strong
enough, it will incite you to feelings, thoughts and actions that
will cause you much sorrow, pain, and anguish; in short, it will
turn your life into one great misery.
Do you ever wonder where all your troubles come from Do
you ever ask yourself why life has to be so difficult and
sorrowful Well, the cause lies in your astral self, which con-
fronts you with your microcosm's entire past in the nadir of
materialisation. In the end, the afflictions caused by this con-
frontation undermine the whole personality-system, and the
process of dying sets in.


THE WAY TO VICTORY
Sometimes, when we are in difficult situations, we cry out
in desperation, `0 God, help me!' But God — the great, sacri-
ficing power of the ever-living fig tree — has always been
helping, right from the very beginning. He wouldn't be able
to do otherwise. For the suggestions, the radiations of the
spirit flow to the personality via the monad. So, in fact, the
negative aspects of all that bitterness we go through in life
are just a delusion, compared to the divine impulse.
All those dreadful things in life are not part of the
Godhead. It is a punishment which the human being brings
upon himself. The opposition, the hindrance he experiences
from the astral self, is the mirror, the sum total of all those
mistaken reactions. The Godhead calls and touches you, and
seeks to conduct you in the one direction that will lead to
liberation. If you do not react in a positive way, the astral self
will thwart you. Your progress will be retarded and ultimately
brought to a standstill, and round and round you will go, stuck
at the bottom of the pit of death.
So you look in the mirror of your past and are confronted
with the sum of all your mistaken reactions. A veritable
magic mirror! And this magic mirror annihilates the persona-
lity-system time after time. No law exists to set any limits in
this respect.
For you, the only law is this you must learn the lesson.
Ultimately, you will have to look right into the mirror of the
karmic self, and you will have to experience the results of
what you see there to such an extent that your I-consciousness
will be purified, and will at last be willing to listen to the
voice of the monad, which is the voice of God.
Then the I-consciousness must act, but not in response to
advice from other people, the kind of advice so often received
when one is in distress. And when it acts, the karmic self will
register and vivify the results. When this happens,


```
THE WAY TO VICTORY
```
what Hermes Trismegistus called `the absolute good' will come
into being.
But as long as you continue to expect anything of this life, as
long as you still feel satisfied with the perspectives this life has
to offer, the astral self will lose none of its power. As long as
you remain in that state of mind, the `absolute good' cannot be
born, even if you follow the advice of the Spiritual School and
change your approach to life, perhaps motivated by the wish to
extricate yourself from some tight corner.
Only when your reactions really change from within and
the results are evident in your life will the hermetic `absolute
good' develop. For, from that moment onwards, there will be
two beings alongside your I-consciousness. In world litera-
ture, these are sometimes represented as the good angel and
the bad angel, the white and the black.
With the help of this new power of goodness, the persona-
lity builds up an ineradicable new soul potential. It is ineradi-
cable since the absolute good which, through right reaction,
has now taken form is straight away connected with the
monadic power seeking to touch the human being. It is con-
nected with the sacrificing divine power operating via the
monad.
This power then neutralises and expels the other astral
power which formerly caused so much adversity, and never
again will it be able to harm the life-system, even though it
will be remembered. The person concerned will then know
evil in its totality, because its scars will have been etched into
his being, but he will no longer have to experience it as such.
Meanwhile, the good aspect of the astral self conveys to the
person the sum of all the insight and skill it has gained
through experience, and with the help of which the absolute
good will ultimately be brought into manifestation.
So let us just briefly summarise all this If you do not react


```
THE WAY TO VICTORY
```
in the right way to God's voice, the voice of the rose, a reac-
tion will be felt in your life. All the mistakes you make are
recorded in the astral self and reflected back to you. So you
are gazing into a mirror, and all those reflections can wreak
havoc in your life. Through this inhibiting mechanism, you
will eventually be forced to listen to the voice.
If, on the other hand, you do listen with your innermost
being, and react in the right way, the opposite will happen.
The results of the positive, good reaction will develop into an
increasingly potent force which will eventually banish
everything that stands in your way. The radiation of the
monadic self will then be integrated in you. The astral self
will therefore convey to you the sum total of all the insight
and skill it has accumulated through experience, and this is
bound to lead, eventually, to the manifestation of the absolute
good, even though it may sometimes take rather a long time.
That is why one can say that all aspects of human life —
whether supportive or obstructive — will ultimately lead to the
state of victory. The very fact of their existence obliges human
beings to demonstrate this magnificent process of self-
realisation sooner or later. All will find the path. Through self-
realisation, all will enjoy victory.
But no one can have something for nothing. No one can
avoid the cup of self-realisation; it must be drained to the last
drop. For a lesson left unlearned, or a power or an ability left
unused, is bound to cause problems sooner or later. The pro-
cess of self-manifestation has to be absolute. Only then can
God be revealed in the flesh. Jesus the Lord, the human
prototype, proved that right to the last moment. It was not
possible for the cup he had to drain to pass Him by. The way
of the cross of roses had to be followed to the very end.
Now one might ask, `Isn't this a rather tough, depressing


```
THE WAY TO VICTORY
```
doctrine How can the degenerate, utterly crystallised human
being of today be capable of making this truth into a reality in
himself'
But to ask questions like that would demonstrate a lack of
real experience, and an inner state of mind still subject to the
scourge of the astral self, which reflects back to the person
concerned the results of his mistaken reactions. Such a person
could not attain a single particle of the absolute good, and
neither could he gain the power necessary to overcome his
astral adversary.
Those who follow this path — and one can only do so after
sufficient purification — know that, right from the moment
when something of the new soul-power is revealed in the sys-
tem, unity is celebrated not only with the monad, but also with
the ever-living fig tree which stands in the midst of God's
paradise, in the divine mixing vessel. The process of self-
initiation begins at that very moment. And just one spark of that
love-power uplifts one's entire being into a state of such
boundless joy and happiness that from then on one will praise
the Godhead for its grace and for the glory of its plan.
Humanity is currently straining itself to the utmost — in a
mistaken reaction to the divine plan — to achieve aims which
comply at least in some small measure with the standards of
human dignity. But you know the result.
Only where the soul is, can the spirit be, and only there can
peace, love, joy and happiness be found. Only in that way does
one transcend life in the nadir and enter upon the arc of
evolution. If this is not the case, only negative results can be
expected. Hence Lao Tzu's words
_If a person tries to perfect the kingdom by means of action, I
perceive that he does not succeed. The kingdom —_ the world of
the two-in-one — _is a sacrificial vessel,_ whose aims cannot


```
THE WAY TO VICTORY
```
be attained by means of the nature-born ego. _If one
works on it,_ with dialectical motives, _it will be
spoiled. If one tries to grasp it, it will be lost._
If you are willing to learn this lesson; indeed, if
you are inwardly capable of learning it, if you are
willing to subordinate the life of your ego, with all
its striving, to the enfoldment of the All, you will
find it possible to reach the top of the mountain.
The idea Lao Tzu sought to convey in chapter
29 should now be clear he was pointing out the
direct route to victory. In the next chapter we
would like to tell you more about this direct
route, placing it in the illuminating light of the
Universal Gnosis.


# 29 - III

## 29— III No one can serve two masters

```
The need to engage in lots of activity is one of the things that
particularly characterises people who are wandering in the
nadir of materialisation, afflicted by the consequences of an
incorrect approach to life, the living account of which is
registered in the astral self. As long as their vitality lasts, they
wage an intense struggle to maintain themselves and their
world.
But even in the primeval past, there were people who had
discovered how useless, how hopeless all that effort is. In
Ecclesiastes we read the words `What does man gain by all the
toil at which he toils under the sun He spends his days in
darkness and he works in grief. Even the night gives his heart
no rest. For all is vanity'. So how true, in this context, are the
words of Lao Tzu
If a person tries to perfect the kingdom by means of action, I
perceive that he does not succeed.
In fact, you know this from experience, so we need not lose
ourselves in arguments and examples.
Nevertheless, one may not simply dispose of this pattern of
things and its all too familiar results by saying, as pupils of the
Spiritual School frequently do, `Yes, that's dialectics, the
alternation of antitheses'. Neither may one point out the use-
lessness of certain activities simply in order to justify inaction,
as many people have done in the past.
The nature of death is like a barren wilderness, desolate and
fraught with danger. The four kingdoms of nature are
completely out of harmony with each other. So the nature-
```

```
NO ONE CAN SERVE TWO MASTERS
```
born human being _has_ to engage in lots of activity, simply in
order to go on existing. If he were to stop being active, there
would be no food, and society would perish in its own filth.
So the requirements and habits of civilisation cannot be
dispensed with, and their cultivation — at least to a minimum
— is to be commended. For the term `holy, sacrificial vessel'
certainly cannot be attached to `the kingdom' as we know and
experience it, even with the greatest optimism.
The reality is that, through many deviations from the path,
every mortal human being has acquired an astral self highly
charged with the sinful sum of the past. This in turn means
that the collective of mortal human beings has drawn around
itself a correspondingly darkened astral life-field. The end
result is that an incessant, daily effort is necessary to hold this
fateful course in check as far as possible.
But it would be wrong to think that these practices, neces-
sary for the maintenance of human life, could ever form the
basis for any liberating development. When people engage in
that kind of activity, believing that by so doing they can
make the world and humankind perfect, they will invariably
discover that they do not succeed, and even that they spoil
everything, that they lose everything.
In the postwar years, the church tried to stimulate new
religious life, to keep the interest of young people and give the
church a place in everyday life. But the outcome has been
negative. By adapting itself to the world of today, the church
has adapted itself to present-day astral conditions, and in this
way it has aggravated its decline, which in turn has only added
to the confusion.
That is why it is important to realise that the world in
which we live is only a relatively small, isolated space within
the holy, sacrificial vessel of the two-in- one. The sacrificial
vessel itself is inviolable; it exists in a state of perfection


```
NO ONE CAN SERVE TWO MASTERS
```
and completion. No more work needs to be done on it, and
certainly not by a nature-born entity imprisoned in the astral
self. _If one works on it,_ in that state, _it will be spoiled._
Therefore, for the person who really understands this
from within, there is only one alternative to liberate
himself, through self-realisation, from the pit of death. So
let us try to see these things as they really are. The person
who wants to follow the path and enter the holy,
sacrificial vessel, will render to the world the things that
are the world's. In other words, since he finds himself
here in this nature, he will naturally do his duty towards
all those with whom he is connected. But he will not do
more than that, for he will render to God the things that
are God's. The sage will avoid any superfluous activity
here in the nature of death, and he will not bind himself to
this nature by conceding to it anything to which it is not
entitled. He will dispel the delusion that it is possible to
glorify this vale of tears.
`No one can serve two masters.' This is what Lao Tzu
meant, and the same message has been communicated by
all the great emissaries of liberation from this vale of
tears. `No one can serve two masters', no one can pursue
two goals at the same time. You cannot serve both God
and your astral self. That is why the Gospel of Jesus
Christ is only for those who are strong in the true, inner
sense of the word. The Spiritual School of the young
Gnosis needs pupils who are strong and steadfast, pupils
who will really be able to lead the way.
If they do so in the right way, the radiance of their hearts
will give warmth to many, and coolness to those who are
consumed by the lower fire. Those who are strong will
support the weak, and those who are moving will stir into
action those who are standing still.

# 30 - 1

## 30— I Not by force of arms

```
In chapter thirty of the Tao Te Ching, Lao Tzu deals with an
issue which has been very topical during this century, the
controversy about the rights and wrongs of using weapons to
settle disputes.
In fact, this controversy reached its peak several decades
ago. Older readers will remember the campaign for disarma-
ment waged by a variety of idealistic groups using the meth-
ods of non-violence. It was a movement that appealed to the
minds and hearts of many millions of humane, thinking
people and it lasted such a long time that, in the Netherlands,
for instance, a law was passed allowing those who, for reli-
gious reasons, did not want to bear arms, to be exempted
from conscription. Many young pupils of our School have
availed themselves of this law, even though the School
would not, and could not, oblige them to do so, because the
decision has to come from an inner state, which is always
subject to a process of growth.
There are also those great, world-famous visionaries who,
by their ideals and their personal example, have profoundly
moved huge numbers of people, inspiring them to adopt a
highly moral standpoint. Nevertheless, it is a fact that the time
of practical idealism, which inspired the hope of so many
young people in the earlier years of this century, is over.
Practical idealism has been rendered out of date by a flood of
world events which have made the majority of human beings
so implacably realistic that it was as if idealism had been
swept away by a storm, having proved powerless to restrain
the alternation of antitheses.
```

```
NOT BY FORCE OF ARMS
```
This was because the concepts on which it was founded,
though excellent in many respects, lacked certain essential
values and certainties. Perhaps you yourself have experienced
that when you have high ideals which are not absolutely
consistent and well-founded in every respect, it is rather like
having built a house of cards; the whole edifice is bound to
collapse sooner or later. Idealism can only become realism
when it is absolutely free of conformity to the world and its
values and attuned solely to the divine plan underlying the
genesis of the true human being.
The idea, the slogan, `no more war' arose from a heartfelt
yearning for true human genesis. But how can such a yearning
ever be satisfied if people do not know the plan underlying
that genesis And if, lacking that knowledge, they just adapt
their ideals to the way of life of twentieth century humanity
It is like a person who sets fire to his house and afterwards
sits down in the ruins and prays `O Lord, give me a house'.
Whereas a person who knows and experiences the reality of
our times understands that, if he persists in his ordinary
approach to life, wars and the rumours of wars, and all the
related tensions and phenomena, will continue to exist.
This point of view is also expressed in the Bible, for
instance in Matthew 24, which says `You will hear of wars
and rumours of war. This must take place, but the end is not
yet.' Why must these things take place
To answer this question we would like to remind you of
something Hermes Trismegistus said `The sun's creation of
life is just as lasting as its light. Nothing can stop it or restrain
it. Countless multitudes of lifewaves throng like a company of
guards around the sun. They remain close to the great
immortals and from there they also watch over human con-
cerns. They carry out the divine will, by means of thunder-


```
NOT BY FORCE OF ARMS
```
storms, fireballs and calamities, and also by means of famine
and war, as a punishment for godlessness.'
At first glance, this reads rather like something from the Old
Testament, evoking ideas of avenging divine justice. But in
reality it concerns the scientific fact that the whole solar
macrocosm — the entire solar system and everything it
contains — forms one formidable and very varied astral life-
system, guided and governed by a single, central law.
Now if a being within this macrocosmic system violates
the system's astral laws, reactions are bound to ensue; they
cannot be avoided. However, they occur not as a punishment,
but as an automatic adjustment to rectify the imbalance
caused by the transgression. The solar macrocosm is a self-
correcting divine system, which simply does not allow any
irregularity. So events which we on earth experience as
affliction are natural adjustments made by the solar macro-
cosm's astral self-rectification system to restore the inter-
cosmic equilibrium. This natural law which always operates
to restore equilibrium may sometimes include an element of
violence, not as a deliberate aim, but as a means of ensuring
the safety of the beings whose creation is the one, divine
purpose of life.
If one understands the irresistible truth of this law, then,
whenever one experiences any affliction, whether as an
individual, or as part of a group, nation, or community of
nations, one will ask oneself this one, all-decisive question
`What standards, what approach should we choose, what
measures should we take, to avoid the consequences of such an
astral reaction in future' People do ask these questions,
repeatedly, but not in the right way. Think, for instance, of the
lethal way in which East and West are arming themselves
against each other as a means of keeping the `peace'. But


```
NOT BY FORCE OF ARMS
```
some of these modern armaments can produce such terrible
effects that neither East nor West would dare to use them. At
the moment, their only function is to serve as deterrents. But
anyone with the slightest understanding will realise that the
thoughts, intelligences and forces behind this whole lethal
arms industry must stir up such astral turbulence that this
alone would be sufficient to threaten humankind with
disasters much worse than wars.
These disasters have already been generated to a certain
extent. The world is divided into two camps. Humanity is split
into two halves, and all the means of modern civilisation are
being used to maintain this split. All the authorities in both
camps support the division on the grounds that if the other
group were to take control, everything would be lost. Both
groups are armed to such an extent that neither side dares to
attack the other. In this way, a state of extreme tension is
engendered in the mighty astral currents emanating from the
solar macrocosm.
So there you have Gog and Magog, as described in the
Book of Revelations. These two astral tensions surround the
whole world and everyone in it. Every single mortal being is
involved, regardless of whether he lives in the East or in the
West. So there are two fiery forces, stoked from below; two
fiery poles, inextinguishably ignited. It is Armageddon, arms
concentration, the end of an epoch. It is total liquidation, the
end of those who place all their hopes in the nature of death. It
means the restoration of equilibrium in the solar macrocosm.
Does the Universal Gnosis proclaim these tidings of doom
Is that the inevitable outcome
Well, that is up to you, to us, and to our fellow human
beings. All these things will have to happen — unless, through
the efforts of as large a group as possible, a different outcome, a
different solution, can be precipitated. But who is optimistic


```
NOT BY FORCE OF ARMS
```
enough to believe in that Would it not be more practical to
follow the path of liberation with both feet on the ground
Would it not be more realistic to seek that path and try to take
along as large a group as possible
That is how it has been in similar periods throughout
humanity's past. `A harvest has always been brought in from the
fields', as one might say, in poetic terms. But the number of
those who remain behind is not to be counted.
Since the days of Lao Tzu disasters and violence have hit
humankind time and time again, and have become more and
more widespread. There is mounting evidence — for those who
have ears to hear and eyes to see — that the kingdom of
humankind cannot be reorganised by force of arms. Whatever
people do to others, rebounds on them. Wherever armies have
fought, thorns and thistles grow. Wars are always followed by
periods of disaster, and it can only end in one final crisis, an
Armageddon.
Gog and Magog constitute the signature of this crisis. They
represent a definitive restoration of the age-long disturbance in
the solar macrocosm, and the discharge of astral karma into the
astral body of our planet, and therefore into the life-field of
humankind.
Having heard these facts, there are certain conclusions it
would be helpful to draw. As we have seen, the whole world
is divided into two camps and the `Gog and Magog' situation
is clearly evident. Also, humanity's astral life-field is closely
attuned to all this upheaval and is therefore utterly poisoned,
to the extent that only people with a strong new soul power
will be able to avoid being harmed by it. Meanwhile, the cur-
rent astral conditions will ensure that everyone else is drawn
right into the situation we have been describing, at the cost of
much suffering. People often regard with disapproval anyone
who does not want to be drawn into this conflict or to take


```
NOT BY FORCE OF ARMS
```
sides in it. So it becomes a matter of conscience, and the
questions we would like to ask are these How should
those who seek gnostic consciousness behave in these
circumstances If, impelled by the divine love which has
touched us, we want to serve the world and humankind,
what is the best way to do it under the present
conditions How, in view of the current world situation,
are we to gain entrance to the arc of evolution
These questions may well have driven you into a conflict
of conscience, and we would like to examine them in the
next chapter, guided by the Tao Te Ching.


# 30 - II

## 30— II The person who is truly good strikes only once

The critical phase in human development which has now
been entered confronts those who seek gnostic consciousness
with the problem of how to behave towards the world and
humankind.
Essentially, the gnostic approach to life will help the
government of a nation to fulfil its proper role. Now this idea
of a gnostic helping his government may sound rather old
fashioned and orthodox - primitive, even - or at least not app-
ropriate for modern times when governments are ousted one
after the other. But it is possible to understand these words in a
way that will be totally new to you, although in fact it is has
very ancient roots. It is just that this approach has been for-
gotten in the course of the ages.
A government occupies a central position among the
people, not only in the political or legal sense, but also in the
astral sense, for it forms an electromagnetic centre on which
converge all the astral currents needed or invoked by the
nation or bound to it by karma.
Via that centre these astral radiations are activated and
spread out over the people. So, apart from the personal rela-
tionship which every individual has with the life-field in
which he lives, there is also a collective relationship of the
nation as a whole to the life-field surrounding it. A govern-
ment acts as the inductor, the centre of contact. A person
who understands gnostic magic will always take this fact
into consideration.
Now it may be that part of the nation disapproves of the
government. The government may be weak, or even primitive.


```
THE PERSON WHO IS TRULY GOOD STRIKES ONLY ONCE
```
It may make decisions which are catastrophic for the nation.
Nevertheless, the natural law - known to gnostic magic - still
applies the government is the central figure, the central
organ, the respiratory centre of the nation's body. The human
body respires and attracts forces via the seven chakras of the
astral vehicle, and the body of a nation functions, in a certain
sense, in a similar way. So the central organ cannot be
bypassed.
That is why the Universal Doctrine always represents
governments as being absolutely in authority - a fact which,
as we said before, the practitioner of gnostic magic will bear
in mind. That is why the Bible, for instance, says `The
authorities do not bear the sword in vain.' (Romans 13  4)
The word `sword', as it is used here, does not refer to some
piece of military apparatus, but symbolises the centre of
governmental power, just as the sword of the Brotherhood of
the Holy Grail is symbolic in meaning.
By now, a query may have crossed your mind `Does this
mean I must accept without question everything the govern-
ment says and does, and obey it implicitly Surely not!'
Our answer is that this question, too, must be considered
from the point of view of astral laws. Then one discovers that,
in any nation, there are numerous larger and smaller groups,
perhaps even amounting to thousands of millions of indivi-
duals, who totally oppose their government. The mental and
astral effect of this is that the highest level of government -
generally the council of ministers - becomes the focus of an
almost inconceivable astral turbulence.
Suppose a decision is taken by the chief ministers which
plunges the whole nation into turmoil. Instantly, currents of
astral force will radiate from all over the nation to that one
centre, forming one seething, whirling astral fire. That is why a
council of ministers is always the focus of an intense astral


```
THE PERSON WHO IS TRULY GOOD STRIKES ONLY ONCE
```
turbulence. In that central focus, every thought and feeling of
opposition bursts into flame, to a certain extent.
And when you consider the tendency of various nations
with interests in common to group together, and the fact that
in such a community of nations one particular nation tends to
dominate - think, for example, of the present power blocs in
the West and in the East - you will be able to see that two
mighty astral vortices must be active in our world. In this way
two tracks are formed - to put it in the language of Taoism -
two tracks of immense astral turbulence, which are poured
out over the whole of humanity via the various centres of
government.
So you see, all the turmoil one hears about in newspapers,
magazines and other literature, or on the radio, is but a pale
shadow of what is going on at these central astral foci. So it is
meaningless to try and stop things like violations of human
rights merely by passing laws forbidding them.
The fact that the astral results of every single thought and
feeling of opposition converge on the government means that
government members are in a far from enviable position, and
not only because of each minister's own personal astral dis-
position. Do not think `the ministers belong to this or that
party, and they will just act in their own personal or party
interests, to the detriment or benefit of the nation.' It is not as
simple as that! In the centre of government, the entire psyche of
a nation comes to expression. That is why it is inevitable that
every nation will have the government it deserves. This is
guaranteed by natural, astral laws.
So the astral centre associated with a government is the
representative of the people in more ways than one. The
governmental representatives of a nation may have weak-
nesses and take misguided decisions which cause delicate
situations to arise. But beyond all that there is the nation's


```
THE PERSON WHO IS TRULY GOOD STRIKES ONLY ONCE
```
astral representation. Such an astral centre of government,
representing the nation, is electromagnetic and attracts radi-
ations and forces from the surrounding astral life-field and
from the solar macrocosm. Via that governmental centre, all
these forces are directly linked with the entire nation. In this
way, in seconds, astral ties are set up, and they are maintained
by day and by night. The practical, demonstrable result is that
every nation receives the government it deserves.
Of course this is no comfort. Knowing this will not heal the
bleeding wounds of our society. But it is the reality of the
situation, and we need to discuss this with you.
Why So that you will adopt an attitude towards the world
and humankind which is quite different from the one you have
had until now. Individually and collectively, human beings
bring their fate upon themselves. So is there no way in which
we can serve the world and humankind
Well, think of chapter 30 of the Tao Te Ching. It depicts a
figure, a master, who says nothing, who gives no teachings,
but only remains silent. Because of the reality of his inner
state, he attracts the forces of the eternal Tao and spreads
them over his audience. That can be very effective if the
audience is properly attuned, if the listeners have an affinity
for that radiation and are open to it. But in our times, the
results achieved by such silent speaking would be minimal.
There are ways of facilitating things, however, which have
been applied by many workers throughout the ages, and they
have also been practised in successive spiritual schools.
Think, for instance, of the singing we often do together at our
meetings. Why do we sing Not because we want to be
devout, but because by singing together we attune ourselves to
each other and synchronise our breath. When we sing to-
gether, all our thoughts are focused on the same words, and in
this way a rhythmic unity is realised. In gnostic terminology


```
THE PERSON WHO IS TRULY GOOD STRIKES ONLY ONCE
```
this is called attunement to the sixth ray, and it inevitably
causes a special power to flow into the group. If the group
participants are open to it, it will be able to affect them. So this
is one of the ways in which a person or group of people could
really be helped.
If a person wants to experience this method for himself,
aided by the gnostic revelation, he will need to begin by
working on himself. For what you are, you will attract. You
yourself determine your experiences. If you recognise this, you
will bring your own state of being into harmony with the
requirements of the path.
You will have to begin by refusing, under any circum-
stances, to send out thoughts and feelings of accusation, blame
and antagonism. This is an attitude of mind which must be
strictly avoided, both by individuals and by groups, and in the
particular as well as in the general sense.
Why For ethical reasons Or because the effects of con-
demnation are sometimes so ugly and painful No, it is
because every condemnatory thought or feeling arouses a
corresponding astral radiation, an astral reaction. If a person
acts wrongly because of his or her astral condition, and you
condemn this action as people normally do, then you summon
that same astral condition and its consequences all over again
for the person in question. It is unavoidable, and more often
than not you are hurt as well, which amounts to the use of
arms. With critical thoughts and feelings we besiege and
menace each other.
By force of arms, nothing essential, nothing good can ever
develop. Please realise that! You can only help your fellow
human beings, your nation and your world through Tao. Those
who want to help any group of people through Tao _do not
subject the kingdom by force of arms._
Criticism is a terrible weapon. That is why the Sermon


```
THE PERSON WHO IS TRULY GOOD STRIKES ONLY ONCE
```
on the Mount says `Judge not, that you be not judged.' Just
look at adolescents, for instance. As soon as the years of
puberty dawn, and the astral body begins to be configured and
activated, a flood of immature antagonism and fault-finding
breaks loose. Whatever was innate in them then comes right
out in the open. That is why so many adolescents change
completely in character during the years of puberty and
immediately afterwards. Currents of astral turbulence exert
their grip on them, and sometimes make them act in ways they
do not like at all.
And that is how misery and sorrow enter our lives. The
human being brings his fate upon himself. That is why you
need to realise that you cannot subject the kingdom by force of
arms. Criticism, we repeat, is a terrible weapon.
`Helping through Tao', what does that mean Well, it con-
cerns an approach to life so sublime, a gnostic, magical prac-
tice so potent, that it takes considerable effort to understand
even a little about it.
The first thing we need to be clear about is that neither
nations nor persons can be helped by force of arms. If a
storm of criticism breaks loose over a person or nation, then
it will be to that person or nation's detriment, and things
will inevitably go wrong. In addition, whatever harm one
does to others will rebound on oneself. `All who take the
sword will perish by the sword.' (Matthew 26  52)
An age-old weapon used throughout all times by ad-
versaries of the Spiritual School, is to surround it and its
workers with criticism. By spending just five minutes a day on
criticism, it is possible to surround such a school with a cloud
of difficulties, unless its focal power is capable of rising
above it and placing itself in Tao.
There are many varieties of weapons, but the most terrible


```
THE PERSON WHO IS TRULY GOOD STRIKES ONLY ONCE
```
of all are the astral ones, which are unknowingly applied by
humanity from second to second.
There are people who support anti-militaristic ideals
and who very seriously practise the consequences in their
lives. But through their constant practice of criticism
these people are so wounding, so deadly in their impact
that a club-wielding caveman would be proud of it. Do
they really think they can serve a government, a nation,
or a person, in this way In fact, one never-ending war is
caused by the astral turbulence resulting from humanity's
habitual behaviour.
Now Lao Tzu says _Thorns and thistles grow wherever
armies have been._ Great wars are followed by periods of
disaster, and humanity has only itself to blame. The human
being brings his fate upon himself. Through its disastrous
habits, humanity keeps the whole nature of death going.
That is why a new approach to life is so necessary for
every practising pupil of a gnostic spiritual school, whose
heart is moved by the plight of the world and humankind.
_The person who is truly good strikes only once,
effectively, and then stops._ He stops, because force is not
his method, as it says in the text. As you may have
gathered, a mystery lies behind this saying, which makes
it feasible for a `single strike' to be genuinely helping and
liberating for humanity. We would like to try and fathom
this mystery in the next chapter.


# 30 - III

# When power has reached its peak,

# people and things become old

We would like to repeat a phrase from chapter 30 of the Tao
Te Ching _The person who is truly good strikes only once,
effectively, and then stops._ Picture the astral state of a govern-
mental centre, anywhere in the world, and think of what we
have been saying about these things. Then you will see all
kinds of astral eddies above and around the central focus of
that governmental centre, which is the object of so much
resentment. These eddies resemble a cluster of dark clouds,
aglow with red and vivid yellow flames, in which the mental
and emotional state of an entire nation is expressed.
This astral concentration is strongly magnetic, generating
many ties with influences and forces present in the astral
field surrounding the world, and attracting whatever is in
equilibrium with it. And that is how, via its government,
every nation receives what it has invoked, and therefore
deserves. This is an immutable law.
Since this astral process is at work in every nation, one can
see that it, in fact, is what keeps the whole nature of death the
way it is. And because it is impossible to bring this chain of
events to a standstill, humanity is heading for a crisis, an
end-phase, in which the impact of this astral burning will be
felt to such an extent that a conflagration by astral fire is
bound to ensue. Truly a discouraging end! In this way life
comes and goes without change — unless humanity totally
changes its approach to life.
Nevertheless, even in the midst of this sad reality, the truly
good human being, the sage, acts to ensure that a harvest of
human souls can still be gathered and brought onto the arc of


```
WHEN POWER HAS REACHED ITS PEAK...
```
evolution and deliverance, and then guided further along it.
The person who is truly good, says Lao Tzu, acts once, with
power. What this means is that the community of the truly good
ones, or those of its members who have been chosen for this
task, send out the astral power of Tao, the light-power of the
Only Good, to the astral nuclei or foci of a nation.
This light-power is quite unlike the astral concentrations
we have been describing, for it differs not only in quality but
also in vibration and power. That is why, when the light-
forces of the Only Good, combined with the energies they
attract from the all-encompassing astral field, come into
contact with the astral foci of the nation, that contact is
bound to be highly explosive. So in a certain, very special
sense, one can really speak of `violence' in this situation. But
it is a violence which is applied only once, and that one
application is more than sufficient.
And see what happens next. These light-power projections
have the effect of dispersing the astral concentrations of the
nation and scattering them in all directions, so that every
individual member of the nation is thrown back on his own
resources. Each individual then not only experiences the results
of personal and collective karma, but at the same time is
brought into direct, personal and bodily contact with the light-
power of the universal life. This is a process from which no
mortal being is exempt.
That is what the holy language of the Apocalypse really
means when it talks about the return of Christ and the last
judgement. When a certain limit has been reached, the forces
of the light intervene to restore the disturbed equilibrium of
the solar macrocosm. The delusion that veiled reality is swept
away, and in the resultant disarray it is possible for the
uplifting astral radiations of deliverance to make contact with
each person individually, providing him or her with a new,


```
WHEN POWER HAS REACHED ITS PEAK...
```
independent opportunity. Then it will have to be proved
whether each individual possesses sufficient openness to
receive the light of the Only Good and to live in its power.
That is how the harvest is gathered. Such a crisis of
separation and sifting develops at the end of every phase in
humanity's progress.
There are countless individuals who have become enmeshed
in the astral doom of their people to such an extent that there
remains no possibility of disentangling them from it until such a
fire of judgement can be unleashed. But through this once-only
intervention of the Only Good, justice can be done to such
people, too. So the intervention of the Only Good is always
completely successful. When the concentration of the astral
clouds has reached its peak, so that the `time of the end' has
come, the Only Good takes action to return all living beings to
`the Way of ways', as Lao Tzu calls it. But we need to be aware
that this unavoidable action also has its tragic side, tragic
because of the fact that humanity has allowed things to go as far
as that. That is why it is said of the sage that

_He strikes once, in the right way, but does not boast of it. He
strikes once, in the right way, but is not proud of it. He strikes
once, in the right way, but only because he cannot do otherwise.
He strikes once, in the right way, but does not wish to seem
strong and formidable._

Once more, the human race has entered the Gog and Magog
phase, so one can foresee what will happen to it now. The two
groups into which humanity is divided have reached the peak of
their power, and that is why Lao Tzu says

_When power reaches its peak, people and things become old.
This means they are not equal to Tao. And whatever is dissi-
milar to Tao will soon cease to be._


```
WHEN POWER HAS REACHED ITS PEAK...
```
So one can see that this situation could also pose a threat to the
Spiritual School from time to time. For the Spiritual School and
its pupils, gathered in the Living Body, occupy an exceptional
place in the midst of the people and their activities. In an abso-
lutely real sense, those who participate in a Spiritual School, a
Living Body, are _in_ the world, but not _of_ the world. So a
Spiritual School stands aloof from the turbulence in which most
nations are enmeshed, for in it — in the group, in the Living
Body — exceptional astral conditions need to apply.
But this is not always easy, for while every pupil needs to
perform his task, his obligations _in_ the world, he is also called
to be not _of_ this world. And that is why every pupil who has
consciously chosen for the Gnosis, and is determined to walk
the path, needs to attune himself completely to the astral field of
the School, and should persistently refuse to make even a single
astral concession to the nature of death.
If we put it this way, you will see how problems and hazards
can develop for the School and its Living Body. Suppose the
majority of the group were to be attuned primarily to the nature
of death. Then the whole group, the entire Living Body, would
inevitably be drawn into ordinary ways of acting and reacting
and would soon come completely under the control of the astral
field of the people. That would put any Spiritual School in
manifestation out of action. Its name could no longer be
identified with its reality. So if a Living Body is put in jeopardy
by being drawn into the astral turbulence of the nature of death,
the closing words of chapter thirty of the Tao Te Ching are
fulfilled

_When power reaches its peak, people and things become old.
This means they are not equal to Tao. And whatever is
dissimilar to Tao will soon cease to be._

From time to time, this pattern can also be observed in the


```
WHEN POWER HAS REACHED ITS PEAK...
```
way certain worldwide movements reach their peak, but then
become outmoded, and afterwards collapse. This happens
because they do not pay enough attention to the dangers we
have been explaining. The moment such an organisation allows
itself to be drawn into the stultifying flux of ordinary human
behaviour, everything goes wrong, and all is lost. This is
something we also need to be careful about, for instance, with
respect to our family life.
So it is understandable that the leadership of a School like
ours may well need to intervene occasionally, to keep the
School's astral centre free of contamination. At such times, a
single, decisive action will be taken, so as to bring the life of the
Living Body back to normal straight away.
Think, in this context, of the archetypal image of the celes-
tial ship, used by the ancient Egyptians. A celestial ship must
be able to sail. Where to To the goal we are shown by the
Gnosis. It must be able to attune itself completely to the sea
of living water, so that it will be able to sail on it. And not a
single astral influence of the nature of death may be tolerated,
because any influence of that kind would act as an anchor
restraining the ship in its passage.
So if purifying action is taken, it is only to keep the ship of
the Living Body on the right course, the Way of ways, Tao.
Thus the Living Body of the School is able to retain its
quality and value as a place of real protection for all those
who genuinely desire it.
As long as it is granted to us, we will steer our celestial ship
onward, along the Way of ways. And we very much hope that
all of you will give us your cooperation. These words are
addressed particularly to all those who are collaborating in the
holy work, and especially to the nucleus-group. We ask you,
especially, to foster the development of the new approach to
life in every member of the group, particularly


```
WHEN POWER HAS REACHED ITS PEAK...
```
now that we have entered the critical phase in this period of
human existence. The new approach to life is the paramount
necessity; it must be adopted by all, for the good of all. We
hope and pray that you will realise this, and join us in doing
everything you can to protect the astral purity and integrity of
the Living Body.



_The finest weapons are instruments of disaster.
Everyone despises them.
Therefore, those who possess Tao will have nothing to do
with them.
In the house of the sage, the left is the side of honour. The
man of war esteems the right._

_Weapons are instruments of disaster; they are not the sage's
tools.
He uses them only when it cannot be avoided.
For him, serenity and quietude are of supreme value.
For him, victory is no cause for rejoicing, for that would
mean to delight in killing.
And he who delights in killing can never reach his goal,
which is to govern the kingdom in the right way._

_The left-hand side is the most auspicious with regard to
everything that brings happiness; the right-hand side is
reserved for misfortune.
The second in command stands on the left; the commander in
chief stands on the right.
Thus they stand as they would at a funeral.
He who has killed many people must weep and mourn for
them.
The victor in battle should be allotted the place reserved for
those mourning the dead._

```
Tao Te Ching chapter 31
```

# 31 - I

## 31— I The finest weapons are instruments of disaster

In its deepest essence chapter 31 of the Tao Te Ching contains
no mystery. Its message is factual and to the point. There is,
however, one curious thing about these anti-militaristic
teachings, which reflect the profound realism so typical of Lao
Tzu, and that is their great antiquity. It certainly shows how
deeply humanity has fallen in the few thousand years since
Lao Tzu's time, and how seriously our habits have
degenerated. What, in Lao Tzu's time, was only tolerated in
cases of extreme need, is thought of as quite normal and
acceptable — even unavoidable — today.
So there is an almost immeasurable difference between the
inner standards of civilisation people lived by then, and those
we live by now. And nothing is better suited to unmask the
delusions people nowadays have about their level of civilisation
than a clear reflection on this chapter.

_The finest weapons are instruments of disaster. Everyone
despises them. Therefore, those who possess Tao will have
nothing to do with them._

Clearly, the ideas expressed in these words were so obvious
to people at that time, that Lao Tzu did not consider it
necessary to explain them in any further detail. Nowadays,
however, militarism is the subject of endless debate among
deep thinkers. Military service for one's country, nation or
state is considered to be a worthy occupation. And there are
military academies, which only accept students who have a
good social background. It is a study to which many talented
and educated young people feel attracted. In our times, those


```
THE FINEST WEAPONS ARE INSTRUMENTS OF DISASTER
```
who bear responsibility for historic feats of war are hailed as
heroes, and accorded great honour and praise.
This problem should be seen as a worldwide phenomenon,
the current signature of the whole of humankind. The present
world economy is strongly dependent on the arms industry.
And more often than not, the industrialists involved are
prominent citizens, not only in terms of their wealth and
economic position, but also in terms of their moral status.
Nobel, for instance, who set up the widely respected Nobel
Prize fund, was an arms manufacturer. So, against the back-
ground of a society in which warlike behaviour is not only
accepted but even admired, we can contrast the ancient words
of Lao Tzu

_The finest weapons are instruments of disaster. Everyone
despises them. Therefore, those who possess Tao will have
nothing to do with them._

These words prove that there was a time when weapons were
universally despised by all who sought the spirit in whatever
way; a time when anyone who possessed Tao could not pos-
sibly have anything to do with weapons.
Shouldn't one draw certain conclusions from this In our
world, at the moment, we have the best weapons. They are so
exceptionally efficient that they could only be devised by the
cleverest and most eminent scientists. These weapons are
capable of destroying the whole of humanity in just a few
minutes. As a result, the awareness that weapons are instru-
ments of disaster is gradually beginning to percolate through to
the great majority of the world population.
However, it is from a totally wrong standpoint! For this
awareness has not developed because of Tao, but because of an
immeasurable fear. Whereas, in earlier times, weapons were
despised out of purely ethical motives. Do you see the


```
THE FINEST WEAPONS ARE INSTRUMENTS OF DISASTER
```
difference Do you see the clear evidence of dialectics in all
this People have always had weapons, of course, but now they
are becoming afraid of them, boundlessly afraid. For the
weapons of which people are now so very much afraid, are
distributed fifty-fifty. Were that not so, people in the West
would not be so fearful.
The weapons are divided between two opposing parties.
In former times, this was generally not the case. Normally,
one group was armed and the other group was not, or at least
barely. So the group that had the weapons did not need to be
afraid. But now the circumstances are quite different.
We only want to make clear to you that the protest against
atomic weapons is certainly not derived from Taoist motives or
directives, but from factual situations, from the results of
worsening decadence. In the past fifty years the last vestiges of
humanity's former, positive morality have perished. They have
been replaced by superficial, social scruples, a thin veneer of
civilisation. Those who possess Tao want nothing to do with
that kind of thing.
What is Tao It is the collective term for everything that is
real and eternal in the human being. It is the growing soul,
which must wake up, which must be brought back to life so that
it can unite with the Spirit, with the Father, with God, and in
this way become a Pymander.
But who can afford the luxury of possessing a soul nowa-
days Or still less to listen to such an anti-social influence
How ridiculous, how anti-social, how unrealistic! That is
why there is at most delusion, studied carefully, persevered
in thoroughly, for a few hours each day. People talk about
the Gnosis. But to practise Tao How could one think of
such a thing
Modern life is anti-gnostic. It is impossible to rise to the top
of the social ladder, and at the same time to serve the Gnosis.


THE FINEST WEAPONS ARE INSTRUMENTS OF DISASTER
Is humanity deliberately wicked, then No, but it is afflic-
ted by the most terrible evil that exists, the evil of ignorance.
Humanity is lost for lack of knowledge. People no longer
possess any knowledge of the purpose for which they were
born. That is why the human instrument, the personality, has
gone off the rails, and why the only reality left for humanity
to clutch at is fear. For human ignorance has gone as far as it
can go, and the only thing left is fear, a boundless fear which
gnaws at the liver.
In former times, a military authority was a strategist, one
single person who directed a huge army as if he were playing
chess. He had to be genuinely skilled, and such skill com-
manded admiration and respect. So the astute army general,
dressed in his smart uniform, was a pillar of society, beaming
with congeniality and polite refinement on public occasions and
behaving exactly as dictated by the laws of his land.
But the advent of atomic weapons has put militarism in a
much starker light. There is an atomic bomb, somewhere, and
a button. And there is a missile, and another button. And
there is another atomic bomb, and another missile, and
another button. One bomb is in the east, the other in the west.
And all know that if one button is pressed, the other will be as
well. Within a few minutes everything could be destroyed —
not only an army, or part of an army, but also all those clever
military strategists, and the whole society they profess to
serve.
Humanity is standing on the brink of suicide, on the verge
of an abyss. That is why only fear is left. With their delu-
sions, their talk, and often with complete insanity in which
everybody is dragged along, people try to deny or mask the
extremity of their need. But the delusion of being able to
conquer everything by force of arms has been destroyed,
because both friend and foe have their finger on the button.


THE FINEST WEAPONS ARE INSTRUMENTS OF DISASTER
The latest delusion is the conquest of space. Modern society
has turned its attention to another subject — and the whole
world lies at its feet.
But again there are two rivals, competing with each other.
One is launched into space to spend a few moments up there
before falling back down again to earth, the trick being to stay
alive and be received by the president. The other one does still
better. He is launched into space and is able to orbit the earth at
a height of a few hundred kilometres before descending again to
the ground, to be received by the president.
Astronauts, people call them. It is the height of delusion! A
delusion which one only becomes fully aware of if one knows
something of the high aim underlying human existence.
So humanity is in the grip of deeply corrosive delusions,
and we are driven to describe them not for reasons of sym-
pathy or antipathy, but because of the profound compassion
to which we are moved by seeing how many millions of
people are plunging into a world of pretence, a masquerade.
What a deep, deep fall!
So now you may realise, perhaps for the first time in your
life, what a gnostic spiritual school really is, and is meant to
be a safe territory in the midst of the horror, an enclave
which is kept free from all the fermentation, decay and dis-
integration going on in the society surrounding it, an enclave
in which one can only dwell if one has adopted a completely
new approach to life.
Did you know that those responsible for guiding the fate of
humanity are making preparations for the end As of old, their
preparations take two forms. On the one hand, efforts are being
made to prepare people for the Gnosis, for liberation as
indicated in the holy language. And liberation will be possible
providing those who are called, and who need the call, are
willing to apply positive new rules in their lives.


THE FINEST WEAPONS ARE INSTRUMENTS OF DISASTER
On the other hand, preparations are being made to save a
small number of human beings should the earth be ruined and
turned into a wasteland. With this small group of survivors it
would then be possible to repopulate the earth under new
conditions, over the course of several million years.
So there are three possibilities first — total destruction;
second — redemption for those who walk the path of liber-
ation; third — survival for a small group of those who will
continue to exist in some remote corner of the world, under
totally changed conditions.
These preparations have had to be made, because the world is
in so much danger of being turned into a wasteland. And to
show that we are not merely fantasising, and to make it clear
that there is a choice you need to make, while there is still time,
we would like to tell you about an article which recently
appeared in the Australian newspapers.
The article reports Professor Ernest Marsden's startling
chance discovery of the only natural laboratory for radiation
research in the world. During the previous winter a group of
New Zealand zoologists and botanists had been carrying out
agricultural experiments on an island called Niu. Although
already established plant species grew abundantly there, it
was found that new varieties did not appear to thrive. In Feb-
ruary 1961 a soil sample from the island was sent to the Uni-
versity of Wellington, where it was analyzed by Professor
Marsden, one of England's most well-known nuclear physi-
cists and a pupil of Lord Rutherford.
His first sensational discovery was that the Geiger-counter
went wild when brought into contact with the soil from Niu.
There was no doubt that this soil was extremely radioactive. So,
without more ado, the Professor packed his bags and

 This was written in 1961.


```
THE FINEST WEAPONS ARE INSTRUMENTS OF DISASTER
```
sailed straight to Niu with a team of scientists. There he
found beautiful, tall people, almost giants, in excellent
health. In some mysterious way they had been spared from
illnesses such as leprosy, tropical fever and tuberculosis,
common on other Pacific islands. The average height of the
island's five thousand inhabitants, both male and female, is
about two metres. They have robust, athletic bodies and are
amazingly intelligent. They are strong, hardy, and of notably
good disposition, and all this despite the fact that the level of
radioactivity in their bones and teeth is ten times higher than
normal. The air, the soil, and the sea surrounding the island
contain twenty times more radioactive material than normal.
And the food contains concentrations of radioactivity up to
one hundred times greater than normal.
Until now, no satisfactory explanation has been found for
this abnormally high level of radioactivity, although Profes-
sor Marsden has suggested the presence of a deep-sea vol-
cano as a possible causative factor. But all this remains only
theory.
Anyway, it was considered more urgent to discover how
the islanders had been able to withstand the lethal doses of
radiation present in their environment and to develop their
immunity. But no satisfying answer could be found to that
question either, because the inhabitants of Niu have only been
burying their dead for the last hundred years, and the bone
samples taken from the dead interred during that period all
showed similarly high levels of radioactivity. Before that, the
dead were taken out to sea in boats and cast overboard.
Only one effect of this radiation-exposure, which seems to
have been going on for at least a hundred years, could be
observed among the inhabitants of Niu. The level of female
fertility is exceptionally low. Tests have shown that one woman
in four is sterile, and one child in ten is stillborn. But


```
THE FINEST WEAPONS ARE INSTRUMENTS OF DISASTER
```
this situation must have improved somewhat in the last twenty
years, because almost half the island's inhabitants are less than
fifteen years old.
However intrigued the research team were by their investi-
gations, they were not able to forget for one moment that their
presence on Niu could be fatal to them, for unlike the natives,
they possessed no immunity to radioactivity and had very few
means to protect themselves from it. All their food had to be
shipped over from New Zealand, and it had to be rich in cal-
cium so as to give their bodies some resistance. And their
living quarters had to be carefully isolated so as to protect them
as much as possible from exposure to radiation.
With a kind of melancholic optimism Professor Marsden
describes Niu as the cradle of a new humanity, and is of the
opinion that the island people could be the only survivors of a
nuclear holocaust.
This report serves to illustrate the fact that there are forces
which will always love humanity unconditionally, and that
these forces are making sure that there will always be ways of
preserving life on earth whatever may happen.
These forces are also behind the Spiritual School's invi-
tation to you. So would it not be a good idea to accept that
invitation, and react positively to it Only you can answer,
and only by your actions.

## 31— II The poisoning of the human life-field

From the point of view of the majority, the campaign against
the use of armaments reached its last peak in the early years of
this century. After that, this struggle for humane values flared
up from time to time, but it was a flame that burned lower and
lower until finally it was virtually extinguished by the two
world wars.
Then another flame was ignited, and quickly became a
blaze. But this flame was quite different. It was more
destructive, more terrible. Social standards were no longer
simply accepted, but questioned, and many people came to
the conclusion that these ideals no longer had any relevance
to modern life. They began to live according to what they
had seen, heard, experienced and learned, and the world
became a chaotic place, a world of murder and shameful
deeds, with police departments waging ceaseless war against
these depravities.
The situation has now become so grave that only a tiny
proportion of the horror ever finds its way into the press. This
breathtakingly rapid decline is the direct consequence of the
instruments of disaster our society is deliberately manufac-
turing as a means of preserving `peace'. We see no sense in
examining this subject from a political point of view, any
more than Lao Tzu did in his time. But we do want to discuss
humanity's bleeding wounds from a psychological angle. So,
to begin, we would like to take the following example.
Imagine you are working in an armaments factory. In the
offices, planners and designers are busy. Meticulously and in
great detail, the designers are drawing the firearms to be


```
THE POISONING OF THE HUMAN LIFE-FIELD
```
manufactured. Using the information they have been given,
they calculate the weapon's probable effect and range, and all
the gadgetry it is going to need.
So, in the end, these employees will have made a thought-
form, a mental image visualised right down to the finest detail.
As soon as their work is done, it goes to their superiors who
develop the original mental image still further by looking at the
design, calculating and recalculating, and visualising how the
product would function under all eventualities.
You know what happens with a thought-form like this; it
grows and grows until, in the end, it becomes like a monster,
living and packed with vitality, and so it is bound to become
extremely large and dynamic, with a powerful radius of action.
For it is kept alive and vivified by a double tier of management
personnel. These people leave nothing to chance, because of
the high economic stakes involved. For if the new weapon is
put into production, special machinery will have to be made
and, perhaps, entire factories may even have to be rearranged.
The factory workers will have to be trained, and all this will
cost millions.
So the planning must be faultless, and this means that the
thought-form will become charged with vitality to the fullest
possible extent, and will become the source of an enormous
wave of pestilence. For — and how can it be otherwise — this
monstrous thought-form is already shooting, destroying and
waging war, and in this way it corrupts humanity's respiration
field through and through.
Did you imagine that those who made and vivified this
thought-form would be able to go home and forget all about it
at the end of the day If you did, you don't know what life is
like for these managerial personnel. Psychologically, they are
seriously damaged. They are no longer capable of letting go


```
THE POISONING OF THE HUMAN LIFE-FIELD
```
of this mental monstrosity. It is a kind of insanity, legalised by
society, and for which they are even paid. For every human
being is bound indissolubly to the thoughts-forms he has
woven.
So when a member of the management in an armaments
factory goes home from work, the thoughts he has been work-
ing with all day long surround him and emanate from him,
and infect his whole family even if he does not talk about it,
because of course, in an industry like the arms trade, every-
thing is top secret. In this way, their families, too, contribute
to the growth of the monster, which very soon grows far
beyond the confines of the factory itself. It becomes an aeon.
Such an aeon can poison an entire nation.
This is still an understatement of the facts, because there is
not only one such factory in the world; there is an entire arms
industry, whose staff are poisoning the life-field of humanity
with a living reality of blood, fire and smoke.
Do you see, then, how all humankind is victimised by
ignorance, by all those planners and scientists who know so
much, but know nothing of the one thing needful What you
are and what you do is projected into the environment around
you. Particularly when you think with such precision and
concentration, the thoughts you project will be very much
alive and charged with vitality. Do you now understand why
the Universal Doctrine states that five minutes' ill-considered
thinking can undo the work of long years How much more
harmful, then, will be the scientifically-applied, daily mental
activity of the planners involved in the top echelons of
industry.
So now we can see clearly what a catastrophe, what a poi-
soning, is unleashed on humankind because of ignorance. In
this poisonous morass, so densely packed around humankind,


```
THE POISONING OF THE HUMAN LIFE-FIELD
```
everything is bound to go wrong. So the fact that — even
now — there are still some human beings who have not
entirely given way under the weight of it all can be called a
miracle. Is it not clear that, under all this pressure, young
people are almost certain to go off the rails, and to show
signs of dehumanisation even at a very young age
Yet this tragedy also has a farcical aspect. Those involved
in the upper echelons of industry, who in fact rule the world,
spend their free time collaborating with priests and other
clergy to find ways of helping young people to be better
behaved. They do everything they can to render harmless the
poison they themselves have made, the explosion they them-
selves have unleashed. But do you see how that false senti-
ment, which is not based on any rational grounds whatsoever,
only makes the situation worse
And what about the ordinary workers What about the
majority of human beings, who are doomed to manufacture,
to make concrete, the thought-forms of their superiors Intel-
lectually, they have not yet reached the same level as the
other group. What is best in them has not yet deteriorated
into the worst.
Intellectually, the working classes are still developing, and
that is why they are victimised. On their tired and bowed
shoulders, they carry the karma of the world. And mentally,
their plight now is even worse than it was years ago, when
few provisions for their welfare were made by the state, and
less concerted effort was made to have control over their
minds. All these people are victimised — and how! — by the
doom of ignorance, an ignorance which is applied as a
science by the upper echelons of industry.

Such, then, is humanity's miserable state; such is the bottom-
less pit into which it has sunk. And although the trend we


```
THE POISONING OF THE HUMAN LIFE-FIELD
```
have been describing would alone be sufficient to guarantee
humanity's suicide, it is only a single aspect of the overall
problem. So wouldn't it make sense to bear Lao Tzu's words
in mind Weapons are instruments of disaster; they are not
for the person of integrity. The sage does not rejoice in their
possession, for that would mean having mass murder in
mind. The whole arms industry and everything connected
with it, everything caused by it, should be consigned to the
place allotted to those mourning the dead. Life is one great
masquerade, a camouflage for death.
Although still living, humanity is already as good as dead
because of what executive groups, in their ignorance, have
done. Humanity is living-dead, its sepulchre still somewhat
whitened on the outside, but inside full of dead men's bones.
The slippery slope people were warned about in Lao Tzu's
time has now become a reality, a certainty.
So if you still want to learn a lesson from Lao Tzu's words,
it must be one which is drawn from humanity's actual state,
and which considers what can still be done to escape this
living death in a totally new way, and to serve ignorant
humanity in this fearful situation.
Talking and explaining is not enough. There is already so
much talking! There are millions of books filled with
protests against nuclear science. Piles of them, metres high.
Many, many texts. But it is no use. Weapons are instruments
of disaster.
Today, there are many scientists and academics who have
come to the conclusion that their knowledge is being applied
in the wrong way, and a number of them have joined to form
an international community to protest about what is going
on, and to try to turn aside the dangers. These people have
realised clearly that things have gone seriously wrong, and
now they are trying to unravel the webs of thought they have


```
THE POISONING OF THE HUMAN LIFE-FIELD
```
woven, and to disentangle humanity from them. They are
weighed down by fear.
These people may well know what they have unleashed,
but if you read what they write, you will see that their efforts
are not making any real impression on the problem. They are
like voices crying in the wilderness. And they have been cry-
ing for many years, without success. Their deep concern for
the problem is a good sign, because at least it shows that they
have realised what they have done, and are trying to undo the
consequences. But even though the signature of goodness
shines from these people, their efforts are bearing no fruit,
apart from providing yet another indication that `the writing
is on the wall' for humankind.
Another indication that `the writing is on the wall' is the
fact that the Spiritual School is now approaching humanity.
The Spiritual School is approaching you, to help you in your
efforts to avoid the deadly danger with which the human race
is threatened.
But those who are able to, those who really want to
succeed in doing that, will need to make some radical
changes. They will need to change their approach to life
in a fundamental way. And it remains to be seen how
many people are genuinely prepared to do that. For they
will need to attack the results of wickedness, brought
about through ignorance, at their roots; they must
eradicate those thought-forms, which are so dangerous in
their radius of action. So if humankind is to be helped,
before it is too late, the only solution is a radical
alteration in our approach to life.
So this is the heart of the matter are we `voices crying in
the wilderness' with respect to you, or are you ready to make
radical changes in your approach to life, changes as radical as


```
THE POISONING OF THE HUMAN LIFE-FIELD
```
those made by the Manichean brothers and sisters in their
time. If we can find a group strong enough to do that,
there will still be much that can be done.


### 31 - III

### Love your enemies

Aided by Lao Tzu's three thousand year-old text, we have
examined the stark reality of human life today, and have seen
just how far it has degenerated. From what we have said so
far, it should be clear that we are not among those who
delight in humanity's downfall, and that it was not to give
ourselves some kind of sadistic satisfaction that we sought to
show you how the world and humankind are perishing
because of their ignorance.
If you share our ideas about these things, you will no doubt
be feeling very deeply, as we do, the need to ask the following
question `What can be done right now to help humankind
Should one talk to people Should one publish magazines, or
write books to make them see sense' But words on their own
would not help. For we know the executives in the upper
echelons of industry, and we know their employees, to use the
terminology of the last chapter; we know how their minds
work. Whatever we said or did would be contradicted, and
would only add to the confusion.
We have seen how humankind is being ambushed and
poisoned by its mental conceptions to such an extent that
destruction is imminent. Well then, let us try to help humanity
by striking at the root of the evil. Let those who participate in
the Spiritual School also create a mental conception. Let us
meet humanity on its own territory, on the mental, astral
plane, which is where the primary cause of the degeneration,
the dehumanisation, is to be found.
But there is a complication here, and we need to understand
it clearly. Lies can have no existence in the astral world.


```
LOVE YOUR ENEMIES
```
Things can only exist there if they are absolutely and positi-
vely authentic. If you are just pretending, you will not be able
to produce a durable mental conception. When the planners in
the arms industry conceive and draw up plans for some new
weapon, it is because they are actually going to manufacture
it. So the mental action precedes the material action. So if we,
in the Spiritual School, want to stop all this, or at least to slow
it down, if we want to purify the astral sphere, then our
material and mental actions will need to go hand in hand.
What we want to make clear is that everything we talk
about in the Spiritual School, everything we want as pupils,
must be put into practice in our lives in the purest, clearest
and most positive way. Only on the basis of such an approach
to life can we make straight what is crooked in the astral
sphere, and calm what is seething with rage. If we want to
help suffering humanity — whose wounds, though self-
inflicted, have been created in ignorance — we will need to
deal with these problems on the astral plane, for only there
can their evil effects be cancelled out. This can only be done
on the basis of an approach to life which is put into practice
in the most positive way, and it will need to be pure, natural,
and without affectation.
Suppose — and now we are entering the domain of the
occult — suppose someone were just to decide to spend five or
ten minutes a day liberating pure astral streams and sending
them to endangered places. The results achieved would be
minimal. But if one were able to liberate an unbroken stream
of love, on the basis of a genuinely pure way of life, success
would be assured. By applying such magic, one would be able
to eliminate any consequence of upheaval in the astral sphere
within a few seconds. And how else could this be done than by
the quintessence of love
We use the word `love' with a certain amount of trepi-


```
LOVE YOUR ENEMIES
```
dation, because all too often people associate it with all that
syrupy make-believe so familiar here, in our nature. But the
love-power we are talking about is love in the sense meant
by the Sermon on the Mount. By the absolutely pure
embodiment of that love, practised in every aspect of one's
life, right through everything, in the material sphere, one
will possess a powerful basis on which to heal the cause of
all the devastation brought about by human ignorance. If
one's mental activity rests on a foundation like that, one will
become so strong that one will be able to do everything.
The Sermon on the Mount also rests on that foundation, as
do the familiar words of Matthew chapter 5 `I say unto you,
love your enemies. Bless those who curse you, do good to
those who hate you, and pray for those who abuse you and
persecute you, that you might become children of your
Father, who is in heaven. You will then be perfect, as your
Father in heaven is perfect.'
The Sermon on the Mount portrays the person who differs
from the nature-born human being in everything he is and
does. And it is soul-rebirth, the possession of the living soul-
state, which makes one capable of living and acting in that
way. So all your efforts need to be aimed at awakening the
living soul-state. Prepare yourself to extend that power to
good and evil alike, for the approach to life we are suggesting
is founded on this awe-inspiring magic of love. It is a practice
which is urgently necessary in a time like ours. It is the only
way of doing anything for the world and humankind the
mobilisation of the power of love.



# 31 - IV

## 31— IV The love of the gnostic magic person

We have seen the reality of modern society, and examined
its causes, and concluded that humankind is being deceived
and poisoned, and is in danger of annihilation because of its
mental activities.
Through their mental creations, sustained over long
periods of time, human beings have turned their entire astral
life-sphere into an almost hopeless confusion. The conflict,
the chaos, the disasters caused by all this in the material
sphere have become so vast that one is moved to ask `How
can this endless torrent ever be brought to a halt' And the
problem is made even worse because, whenever human
beings are faced with disaster of any kind, they always resort
to brute force as a remedy. They ask themselves, `What
power can be applied to eliminate this danger' People keep
on looking for weapons to avert the threat of disaster, obli-
vious to the fact that by doing so they only intensify the
causes and make the results much worse. Remember Lao
Tzu's words _The best weapons are instruments of disaster._
We have shown you how incontrovertible these words are.
So now the task, the problem facing us is this `What should
the Spiritual School do in the face of this great emergency'
Clearly, the time has come for a new and powerful course
of action. Now the gnostic Spiritual School must prove what it
is, what it is capable of. Now the opportunity must be grasped,
and we must answer the question `What must we do to avert
the immense dangers threatening the human race'
Let us step back for a moment, so that we can examine the
problem as objectively as possible. Must we intervene in


```
THE LOVE OF THE GNOSTIC MAGIC PERSON
```
external events Must we make protests, for instance, as so
many people are doing Should we write letters to the
authorities Should we draw attention to the dangers by acts
of civil disobedience Or should we perhaps act in a
revolutionary way, trying to instigate political moves that
would prevent the powers behind the scenes from being able
to carry out their designs
But none of those things would work because, in one way
or another, they all involve conflict. Even if one were only to
oppose the mental activities of humanity on a mental level,
by thinking contradictory thoughts, it would still involve
conflict. And as we know, mental weapons are the most
terrible weapons.
_The finest weapons,_ as Lao Tzu says, _are instruments of
disaster._ And pupils of the Spiritual School are better able
than anyone else to know that it is mental weapons, especi-
ally, which must be shunned as the fiery pest they are. So the
real tragedy of the situation lies in the fact that, although a
very large number of people realise that things are going
seriously wrong, and are aware of the extreme peril facing
the human race, they are prevented — by ignorance — from
being able to act in the only way capable of providing
genuine succour to seeking humanity. So this is the point we
would like to stress, with as much emphasis as we are able
the only possible way of helping humankind must be sought
in the application, the most radical application, of the power
of universal love.
Having said this, we realise there is much more we need to
tell you about the power of love and how to apply it, if we are
to avoid being misunderstood. For there are so many different
opinions on the subject that we could easily be lost in a
labyrinth of ideas, if we are not careful to explain exactly
what the School of the Rosycross means by this. So, to bring


```
THE LOVE OF THE GNOSTIC MAGIC PERSON
```
ourselves closer to an understanding of what love does mean,
we would like to begin by explaining what it does not mean.
We would like to describe for you how love tends to be
sought for and practised by the _church-going_ person, by the
_humanist,_ and by the ordinary, _egocentric_ human being. In
contrast to all this we would like to describe love as it is
practised by the person who understands _gnostic magic._
In the church, ideas about how to love tend to be inextric-
ably bound to delusion, and therefore to ignorance. The
church authorities inculcate in their congregations such literal
acceptance of the Holy Scriptures, treating them as a written
document of which not one jot or tittle may be lost, that the
actual words become a formidable obstruction to true under-
standing. In this way, the faith of the average church-goer
tends to have the effect of attuning him not to God, who is
love itself, but to a text which interprets that love. And that is
something quite different from being attuned to love itself.
Church-going people often put their faith in persons who
preach love. But they tend not have enough inner knowledge
to verify the truth of what is being said. Not that there is any-
thing wrong with preaching love, but if the listener lacks that
inner ability to check things, he will always be dependent on
external authorities, which means he will run the risk of being
exploited. And if one is exploited, it is either because one
possesses no soul quality at all, or because, if one does possess
some soul quality and therefore undergoes the influence of
love, one does not yet have a freed, fully autonomous soul.
For there is a tremendous difference between the person
whose soul has become free and autonomous, and the person
who only possesses soul quality. A bound soul is always vul-
nerable to delusion in one form or another.
This applies to those who seek humanitarian values, too.
The desire to experience a universal brotherhood of man is


```
THE LOVE OF THE GNOSTIC MAGIC PERSON
```
clear evidence of the possession of soul quality, even if the
person concerned does not know that such an experience is
not possible in dialectical nature, and that the Kingdom of
God cannot be founded in the nature of death. Similarly, the
wish to see evil — though quite definite — as a temporary
phenomenon which can soon turn into good, is also an
unmistakable indication of the presence of soul quality. But
without the additional dimension of gnostic insight, the
pursuit of humane values can only lead into a morass, and
following such guidelines would be like burdening a baby
with the leadership of the world.
To prevent misunderstanding we need to stress, before we
go any further, that there are many ways in which soul quality
can be gained. The experience of suffering, for instance, often
brings about an increase in soul quality. When people are
beaten and trampled by life, you must have noticed how they
nearly always become milder in character, because of all the
suffering they have been through. It is like that, for instance,
with people who are very ill. Because of their afflictions, they
assimilate soul quality. They are touched by the all-encom-
passing field of what Plato called the `World Soul'.
The World Soul encompasses everyone, without excep-
tion. Whenever anyone forgets his ego for a moment
because he is immersed in suffering, then the World Soul
always touches him. In this way the person is charged with
soul quality by the all-encompassing field of the World
Soul, even if he does not know what is happening, and is
therefore in ignorance.
That is how you can come across the kind of people who
are very noble, full of soul and full of love, but who either do
not know of the one path or refuse to walk it. Such people are
like the `rich young man', full of potential but lacking the one
thing needful. They turn away from the path because they


```
THE LOVE OF THE GNOSTIC MAGIC PERSON
```
believe what they are seeking can be found in the world. They
do not know it is not of this world. They think they are already
standing on the path, and do not realise the love-power they
have experienced came from the World Soul. They are not
able to consider this idea, because they are unaware of it. So
they misinterpret the love-power they have experienced as
being part of matter, part of our world.
The approach to love taken by the totally I-centred human
being is familiar to all. It is always expressed within sharply
defined limits. And it is partial, for within those limits
nothing is tolerated which could threaten the person's own
ego in any way. In the interests of a so-called `uninhibited
love-life', social taboos are overturned without hesitation.
People who believe they must follow such a `modern' path do
not belong in the Spiritual School. Human beings who are
totally absorbed in their own ego are on the lowest level of
life; in fact, they are not living, but dying.

Having said all this, we would like to explore the nature of
divine love, the love which is above everything, the love
which makes everything free. For that love is also the power
with which all the dangers in the world can be completely
dissolved. It is that power with which the Spiritual School
will have to work if it is to help, and if possible, to save all
those who possess soul quality. So it is that power which you
will need to possess and, if necessary, to use. That love power
must be freed, and it can be freed by those who possess a soul
which has been freed.
As long as a person's soul quality remains bound to the
nature-born personality, and in particular to the vital body,
the etheric double, then whenever there is a problem, the ego,
the personality, will be involved, even if the person does not
want that to happen.


```
THE LOVE OF THE GNOSTIC MAGIC PERSON
```
When problems arise between pupils of a Spiritual School,
this is almost always the cause. Most pupils possess an
abundance of soul quality, but it is bound to, and interwoven
with, the nature-born ego. If only they had pure soul quality
untainted by anything else, no problems would arise between
them and they would completely understand each other and
be united in harmony.
But time and time again, whenever interpersonal contact
takes place, the ego is involved. And every ego is different,
and has various kinds of karma. That is why people keep on
coming into conflict with each other, even though they do
not want to. Only when the soul is freed, disassociated, from
the nature-born personality, and can function autonomously,
like Jesus Christ, our Lord, does it gain its full power.
When we say this, we do not mean something which
happens when you die, but a new state of life, in which the
candidate genuinely possesses a soul which has been made
free, just like Jesus the Lord, the prototype of all truly
modern human beings. Only if a person becomes a follower
of Jesus the Lord in that sense, will he no longer place the
nature-born personality in the forefront in his liberating
work, but will allow it to play a subordinate role. Only the
nature-born personality who has brought to a good end his
work in imitation of John — the work of making straight the
paths for his God — is capable of work in the gnostic
magical sense. We feel sure we are telling you about values
and forces, aspects and possibilities of the gnostic life about
which you may never have heard before. Yet there are many
pupils who are involved in preparing themselves for this
work. And we should count ourselves fortunate indeed if we
were able to provide everyone with clear indications about
the way in which, in one short lifetime, the soul can be set
free and disassociated from the nature-born personality.


THE LOVE OF THE GNOSTIC MAGIC PERSON
You must not imagine the prototype, Jesus Christ, as a dis-
tant ideal. The Spiritual School assures you that anything
you could possibly want to achieve in nature would be more
difficult than the imitation of Christ, understood in the
gnostic sense. So we hope we will be able to show you
where to look for the key to life, for your finding it could be
of profound significance for the whole human race.



# 31 - V

## 31— V You are the salt of the earth

We would like to explain how gnostic magic is applied, and
to show how worthwhile and necessary it is, for it is the only
means of saving the world and humankind.
So we will begin by considering, again, the figure of Jesus
Christ, the Son of the Father, whose followers we all need to
be. If we choose Him as our example, we will see that He was
man and God, which means to say that He was a nature-born
human being and also, in the true sense, a soul-born human
being. Everything in his life proved that He was completely
free as to the soul. As far as his soul was concerned, He was a
free citizen of the heaven-earth, while as a nature-born human
being He had made the highest state attainable in nature his
own. For, as to nature, He was completely transfigured. So in
that respect He was completely _in_ the world, while as a soul-
being, he was not _of_ this world.
As such He was capable of expressing himself in all
aspects of our cosmos. He was one with the Earth Logos and
one with the Earth Spirit. He ascended into heaven and des-
cended to the earth, which, as the Gospel puts it, is the divine
footstool. So his sovereignty was complete throughout the
cosmos, and to Him was given all power in heaven and on
earth.
But you need to see this entity as the prototype for your
own imitation of Christ. You need to realise that He himself is
inviting and urging you to become like Him, because you
have the ability to do so — if only you are willing to stop see-
ing Him an unattainable idol, or as a fairytale — if only you
would begin to understand the imitation of Christ as the high


```
YOU ARE THE SALT OF THE EARTH
```
vocation all of us are called to pursue. For then, as a partici-
pant in a gnostic Spiritual School, you would see the entire
process of gnostic magic opening before you, in Him, through
Him and unto Him. Then you would discover how this high,
serene love wants not only to make you free, but also to grant
you all power in heaven and on earth.
If you reflect on this, you will realise that it is not a state
which arises from one moment to the next, but that there is a
process of growth, a path, which everyone will be able to
follow at their own pace. And even if progress on the path is
very gradual, there will still be a daily increase in grace,
power, and divine Love, if only you are willing to let go of
all the fairytales the church has suggested to you and which
have burdened you from your youth onwards. You need — if
we may repeat it once more — to see Jesus the Lord as the
prototype of the one true Human Being, who you, too, must
become.
So do not ask, `Where must I begin' Begin at your own
beginning, in the circumstances life offers you at this mo-
ment. Make your paths straight, wherever you live, wherever
you are. In all things — which means, in everything that lies
within your personal range of action — become like John.
That is the fundamental requirement.
One person's radius of action may be larger than another's.
But remember, if someone with a larger radius of action than
yours does not utilise it, whereas you, with perhaps a smaller
one, do use it, you will still be greater than he is.
So we can begin our imitation of Christ straight away, here
and now. If we do so, together, we will be able to form one
group, united in the most complete and perfect sense, and
filled with the greatest possible respect towards each other.
We will form one, steadfast multitude, a community of John,
walking a straight path through the desert, to the one goal.


```
YOU ARE THE SALT OF THE EARTH
```
Thus we will be among those who have been baptised with
the living water, the living water of the World Soul, which
surrounds us all.
We need to stress that the entire fallen cosmos is encom-
passed by the World Soul, and that everyone who is even
slightly open to it, everyone who forgets his own ego, even if
only for a moment, will receive the radiations of the World
Soul in his system.
Clearly, it is not enough merely to say this, or to focus on it
in a mystical way. It is not enough only to attune oneself
inwardly to that path. The primary necessity, right from the
outset, is the adoption of a concrete, radically different
approach to life. That is what is required of you. If you can
sense the World Soul's serenity, if its radiation-values
penetrate right into your innermost being, choose an approach
to life which is in harmony with that. Such an approach to life
will naturally differ in every respect from the approach of
those who are still ignorant of the one goal of human life.
The structure and guidelines of this approach to life are
given in the Sermon on the Mount. Right from the moment
when you first became more or less conscious of life's reali-
ties, you may already have been trying to put the Sermon on
the Mount into practice. It was for that purpose that the
human race was given the Sermon on the Mount. But if you
live on the level of the ordinary nature-born human being,
because you are unaware of the goal of human life and of the
need to become like John, it will be impossible for you to
practise the Sermon on the Mount, and you will find yourself
locked in a constant struggle with everything it represents.
So we would like to ask you to read and reflect on the
Sermon on the Mount every day for a period of time. And if
you want your efforts to bear fruit, it is logical that you will
need to change your perspective, so that the vantage


```
YOU ARE THE SALT OF THE EARTH
```
point from which you are seeing things is attuned to the
Sermon on the Mount. So you will need to seek another level
in your life, a level that may lie high above the level of the
ordinary, average human being. And on that level you will
need to base your approach to life.
Pupils of a gnostic Spiritual School have proved, by the
very fact of their pupilship, that they have long been seeking
a different level of life. Why else would they have become
pupils
But here, a warning needs to be given let no one climb too
high. Climb only to a level at which you can remain without
falling or behaving in a way which is a parody of the real
thing. Do not say `I am standing on this level,' while in prac-
tice you are far below that level.
Climbing to such a new level and maintaining oneself
there is called `climbing the mountain'. Only on that new
level can the prototype of the noble, true Human Being be
met. So, if you want to respond to our proposal, listen, now,
to the Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount.

`And Jesus, seeing the multitude, went up on the mountain,
and when he sat down his disciples came to Him. And he
opened his mouth and taught them, saying

Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven.

Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.

Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
for they shall be satisfied.

Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.


```
YOU ARE THE SALT OF THE EARTH
```
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.

Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of
God.

Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and
utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so
men persecuted the prophets who were before you.

You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how
shall its saltness be restored It is no longer good for anything
except to be thrown away and trodden under foot by men.

You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid.
Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but on a
stand, and it gives light to all in the house.

Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.'

Throughout human history, whenever there has been a
period of time during which the conditions were right, there
has come into existence a large group of human beings
whose inner nature was out of the ordinary. Intuitively, such
people are aware that there must exist a very actual, very
different, new way of living, an approach to life which goes
far beyond anything possible within the scope of mysticism
or humanism, and which is certainly not within the scope of
the ordinary ego. The more time goes by without the mem-
bers of such a group having found what they are seeking, the
more a certain kind of tension increases within them.


YOU ARE THE SALT OF THE EARTH
Imagine a person who has that kind of disposition, and who
in fact, is affected by the World Soul. Because of what he
yearns for, the forces of the true light are able to touch him.
He tries to make the path as straight as possible, but so far, he
can only perceive the desert of life. Because he is touched by
the World Soul, and because he is in such a state of expec-
tation, an intense tension will arise in him `Surely there must
be a way out Surely there must be a solution for the human
race, for the whole of human existence Isn't the light always
victorious in the end
This psychological disposition, this state of tension, prepares
the person concerned to such an extent that, eventually,
his level of awareness is bound to be raised, or at least he will
become susceptible to a heightened level of awareness. When
this critical point has been reached, because the tension has
reached its maximum, the members of that exceptional group
will have to prove whether or not they are really disciples of the
sublime, noble prototype, Jesus Christ our Lord.
That is what is meant by the opening words of the
Sermon on the Mount `And Jesus, seeing the multitude,
went up on the mountain, and when he sat down his
disciples came to Him.'
So the position Jesus the Lord adopts is a higher one, and it
cannot be otherwise. He places himself on a higher level than
the one people are accustomed to in dialectical nature, and He
expects those who really understand to come to Him.
It is pointless to gaze upwards from the ordinary, nature-
born level in the hope of catching a few reverberations from
the Sermon on the Mount. No, one needs to be capable of
raising one's inner being to the level of the mountain. Only
then will you be able to understand completely. And only
then will you understand what, before that time, you regarded
as impossible.


YOU ARE THE SALT OF THE EARTH
To you a voice is calling `Go from glory to glory.' To you
is proclaimed such an all-encompassing, tremendous
optimism, a message of such majestic and glorious attain-
ment, that everything we have so far tried to convey to you
about the soul pales into insignificance by comparison. If you
can raise your inner being above the ordinary, nature-born
level, if you can raise yourself inwardly, etherically, to the
higher level of life which is called `the mountain-top', and in
this way prove that the soul quality already accumulated
within you has become active, you will hear the following
declaration, resounding with tremendous positivity, like a
mantram burning inside you `Blessed are those who yearn for
the spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven`.
As soon as this new state is realised in your system, and
you are thus linked unmistakably to the World Soul, you will
have entered the radius of action of the divine realm. You
will have entered the state of blessedness. If only you
consistently adopt an approach to life in harmony with that
state, you will experience blessedness continuously, as a
consolamentum. That continuous state of being will provide
a consolation which makes bearable all the sorrows one
might have to undergo as the result of life in nature.
Such people will be capable of the heroism of meekness,
through which it is possible to overcome and inherit the
earthly realm. They will be able to lift the scourge of igno-
rance and its results. All who, in that high, serene state,
hunger and thirst for righteousness, are bound to be satisfied.
It is certain that, being merciful, they will obtain mercy;
being pure in heart, they will restore to life the God in them;
and, being peacemakers, they will know peace, the profound
inner peace of the children of God.
Doesn't all this point towards rapid soul growth Doesn't
all this point towards soul-awakening, towards an ever closer

contact with the centre of the new realm That is why
there is blessedness, too, in being persecuted for
righteousness' sake, and in being reviled and oppressed.
For the counternature cannot tolerate it when the divine
nature breaks loose from under it and goes its own way.
So the fire of persecution only serves to prove the
counternature's weakness, and to show that it is in retreat.
To you it is given to live in that high state of being, to
enter that great reality. So clear reflection on this task is
needed. It is a task which can be yours only if you have
heard the Beatitudes from within, if you have experienced
their power, and are determined to go on living on the
new level o


# 31 - VI

## 31— VI The purifying salt

`You are the salt of the earth.' These are the words spoken to
those who, standing on the mountain, have received the
blessing of the beatitudes, and have thus been linked with the
living salvation of the kingdom. Such people receive a task to
which their entire being will need to be devoted. This task
has to do with that well-known aphorism of the classical
Rosicrucians, which states that the _sal mineralis_ must
become the _sal menstrualis._
We have explained the inner state one must enter if one
wants to experience genuine soul growth, which culminates
in soul maturity. It will be clear that such positive soul
growth is only possible through the consistent practice of a
totally new approach to life, which transcends the ordinary in
every respect.
It is an approach to life which affects every aspect of your
existence. First and foremost, it must be applied to yourself,
to your thought-life, for instance. It must be carried through
into your private life, in your own home, and continued in
public, in all your interactions with your fellow human
beings. When a person adopts that consistent approach to
life, a radiation emanates from him, because then he is acting
consciously with the light-power which is touching him.
We have already mentioned before that the World Soul
encompasses every human being and will enter the persona-
lity whenever it is open to it. Through the new approach to
life one is able to retain the soul-power thus gained because
one is working with it. So, when someone practises such an
approach to life, a light will emanate from him, an influence,


```
THE PURIFYING SALT
```
a power, which will be experienced by all others.
Now it is that light which acts as a purifying, cleansing
salt, in every aspect of life. That is why Christian Rosycross
carried salt with him when he went on his journey. How
would a Rosicrucian, how would a pupil of the Spiritual
School, be able to work without that purifying salt There-
fore, anyone who wants to do something to help humankind,
must at least possess that salt, must at least be able to dif-
ferentiate that light-radiation. That is why we state that, to
the light of the soul, everything must give way. Nothing can
withstand it.
Of course that is not true of negative soul-quality. We
have discussed how someone can be charged with the
radiations of the World Soul without knowing it, and then is
unable, because he lacks the right insight, to do anything for
others apart from adding to the difficulties and obstacles
afflicting them. In this way, the light is placed under a bushel
of ignorance.
But as soon as one is able to raise oneself above the level
of seeking life to that _new_ level of life, the candle-flame is
ignited, the light of the candelabrum becomes perceptible.
Then the soul-power is rendered active and dynamic, and the
electromagnetic influence of that light will be capable of
stilling all the storms which rage in the astral sea. In this way,
the light will have to shine. And that can only have one
result the glorification of God, our Father.
We cannot refrain from telling you time and time again
that there is but one means of avoiding a serious human
catastrophe, and that is the approach to life described in the
Sermon on the Mount. We were emphatically urged to try to
guide you towards that sublime new life-practice. It is an
approach which is totally alien to the average person. It is a
life-practice which you cannot learn by rote, and which does


```
THE PURIFYING SALT
```
not allow itself to be fixed in verbal formulae `Now I must
do this and afterwards I must do that.' Neither is it a practice
which allows itself to be described in a book. It is a living
reality, profoundly interwoven in every aspect of one's life
and practised in everything one is and does. It is practised in
relation to every person with whom you come into contact
and every thing you meet. The positively applied light of the
soul is a power to which everything must give way. It is with
this weapon of love that you must learn to work.
You will have noticed that we stand before a turning point
in our work. All pupils are now expected to practise their
pupilship in a totally new way, and to profess it by action.
Only then will they enter the training school of the Gnosis.
We hope and pray that you will resolve, from within, to join
us in entering this training school, in which we will be made
ready to work for the salvation of humankind.



_Tao is eternal and has no name._

_Its essence is simple and small, yet not even the world in its
entirety would dare to seek governance over it._

_If princes and kings were able to sustain it, the ten thousand
beings and things would yield to their governance._

_Heaven and earth would unite and cause a gentle dew to fall,
and the people would enter harmony spontaneously, without
needing to be told._

_When Tao was apportioned, it was given a name._

_With that name, one has to know how to contain oneself._

_He who can contain himself will not enter into danger._

_Tao will be spread throughout the All._

_All things will return to Tao, like mountain streams, which
return to the rivers and then to the sea._

```
Tao Te Ching, chapter 32
```

# 32 - I

## 32— I Heaven and earth will unite

We would like to consider chapter 32 of the Tao Te Ching, for this
testimony, communicated by an entity of the highest eminence and
handed down to us in a remarkably unspoilt condition despite its
great antiquity, confirms the words of the Spiritual School of the
Golden Rosycross. We have been telling you about the need for
gnostic magic, and about how a priesthood and a new temple-
structure will be necessary if gnostic magic is to achieve its full
potential in the temples of the Rosycross.
That is why we are speaking about this ancient prophecy of Lao
Tzu, because the world is entering a time of total transformation,
and humanity is standing on the threshold of a new age. If the pupils
of our School really understand the significance of the times we are
living in, and if they are genuinely aware of their God-given
possibilities, it will be possible for this prophecy to be fulfilled —
fulfilled by the community which has assembled in the Spiritual
School of the Golden Rosycross. So let us analyse chapter 32 of the
Tao Te Ching, and try to apply it to the situation we are in today.
Let us consider whether the potential for attainment really is
present.

```
Tao, `It', the power we call `God', is transcendent with respect
to what it has created, but at the same time it is the power
which moves and governs the entire All. All created things,
yes, all creatures, bear the awareness of Tao at the core of
every atom of their being. So nothing is closer to us than Tao,
the divine power which comes to judge the living and the
```

```
HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL UNITE
```
dead, but which is also the power that leads to blessedness.
Humanity experiences Tao's power of judgement through-
out almost every moment of its existence. The question now is
whether this divine power of judgement can be transformed
into the divine power that leads to blessedness, to fulfilment.
That is the great problem facing humankind. If you are a
sincere pupil of the sevenfold Spiritual School, you will know
that together, as a group of fellow pupils of the Rosycross, we
can solve this problem for ourselves and our fellow human
beings with the aid of gnostic magic.
So it is crucial that you keep on examining, every single
day of your life, what the elements of gnostic magic are, and
whether your approach to life is really in harmony with them.
For the salvation of the whole human race — right now, in
the present — depends on it. If only a relatively small group
of human beings were able to sustain Tao in dialectical
nature, as a radiative factor of the kind meant by Lao Tzu,
then the whole of humanity would have to submit to it. What
is more, _heaven and earth would unite and cause a gentle
dew to fall, and the people would enter harmony
spontaneously, without needing to be told._
We understand this, and that is why we would like to go on
deepening our perspective of gnostic magic. We need to
begin by stating that Tao needs to be the core essence, the
underlying foundation of all gnostic magic. No other power
exists, no other influence, neither in the material sphere nor
in the reflection sphere, that could take the place of Tao.
The pupil also needs to understand the need for a vehicle
which is in harmony with Tao, and is therefore capable of
transmitting and working with it. He will need to know that
vehicle, to possess and experience it, as the soul. So the
pupil's first priority after having gained wisdom and insight,
should be to attain the soul, the soul-body. One may safely


```
HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL UNITE
```
say that all pupils possess a powerful soul-principle and that
most already have a soul-body. So they ought to be able to
practise gnostic magic.
But it is especially those in whom is growing that so
remarkable, necessary and sensitive vehicle we call the soul,
who need to exercise the utmost care and attention with res-
pect to their approach to life. For surely you know the words
`The soul that sins must die' This saying should not be
regarded as a kind of mystical slogan no longer meaningful
in a world like ours, but as an unavoidable fact applicable to
anyone who has gained some soul quality.
When a person gains soul-power, the spirit, Tao, is always
immediately attracted and activated in that person's life,
because of the magnetic power which is one of the soul's
attributes. Where the soul is, there the spirit is, also. So it is
clear that, whenever the person in whom soul-power is pre-
sent reverts, even momentarily, to the mundane approach to
life, the spirit, Tao, is not able to function as a renewing
power, as a divine power which imparts blessedness, but
only as a disintegrating power, a fire of judgment.
Let us assume for the moment that you possess soul-quality,
and that you are therefore approaching Tao, in whatever way.
At times there may be only a few minor details of your
approach to life which are attuned to the ordinary, mundane
level. Nevertheless, Tao will then always function as a fire of
judgment. That is why soul-sensitive human beings, people in
whom the soul is developing, are so frequently afflicted by
adversity. For the stronger their soul-quality, the more
powerfully the spirit functions as a power of judgement. The
stronger the current, the stronger the shock. This is such a
simple truth that even a child could understand it.
The power of judgment always acts correctively. That is
why those who are approaching the fundamental power


```
HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL UNITE
```
underlying gnostic magic, those who genuinely long for that
divine power which leads to blessedness, need to be
exceptionally alert with respect to their approach to life, in
order to avert the fire of judgment. For they are entering the
phase of transfiguration and are therefore arousing all the
phenomena connected with the soul. So they need to trans-
form the fire of judgment into the grace which imparts the
blessedness of the children of God.
Your approach to life needs to be attuned to the intentions
of the spirit right down to the finest detail. Only in that way
can you avoid all those familiar, and perhaps, as yet,
unfamiliar afflictions and situations that could delay your
progress on the path. Even more importantly, only in that
way will you become suitable and worthy to practise gnostic
magic, which has become so urgently necessary.
But now let us go further. Let us suppose you are
approaching Tao, the original foundation of all things, and
that as a result the soul is growing in you. Let us assume
your approach to life is attuned to Tao, right down to the
finest detail, so that your whole existence is becoming open
to the spirit. The result will be that your radius of action and
your state of consciousness will gradually expand, and in
this way you will be guided further and further along the
path, day by day.
Clearly, this is bound to have a profound effect on your
mental activity. The time will come when you will think in
quite a different way than others do. What is of great interest
to them will not be important to you. You will even lose the
ability to concentrate on such things. Perhaps you have
experienced that already, in which case it is proof that you
have died to that part of the reflection-sphere we call the
mental sphere. It is as if you have bored a kind of shaft
through the mental part of the reflection sphere. Then you can


```
HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL UNITE
```
pass through the mental sphere without being part of it. Or,
to use the terminology of the gnostic gospel of the _Pistis
Sophia,_ you can travel through it, without the powers and
aeons of that sphere being aware of it.
The next indication of your progress on the path will be a
transformation in your desire-life. Many pupils worry about
their desires. However, if you are genuinely focused on Tao,
in the deepest sense of the word, your desires will change
fundamentally, so fundamentally that in this sense, too, you
will become unworldly.
This alteration involves not only your inner orientation and
soul-development, but also your physical well-being. Your
bodily needs will change, too, and if you do not adapt
yourself to these changes, your body is likely to become ill.
So if you have any physical problems, it might be
worthwhile to consider them from this angle.
All this is proof that your astral body is changing in a fun-
damental way, so that the chakras no longer rotate in the
same way as they did before. Instead of turning from left to
right, all the greater and lesser wheels of the chakra system
have started to turn in the opposite direction, from right to
left. When that happens, you can pass through all the astral
planes of the reflection sphere, without the forces of those
spheres being able to influence or restrain you. Indeed, they
will no longer even be able to perceive you.
The same process takes place in the etheric body and the
etheric sphere, so that ultimately you will have bored a shaft
right through all the dialectical etheric spheres, and your
threefold self of spirit, soul and body will have become a
unity.
That is the fundamental principle of gnostic magic making
yourself personally free from the etheric spheres of ordinary
nature. How does one do that By being exclusively focused


```
HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL UNITE
```
on Tao, and accepting all the consequences. As a result,
your needs and interests will change fundamentally, and
you will bore a shaft through all the domains of the
archons and the aeons of the reflection-sphere.
Then, as we said just now, a unity will arise between the
threefold spirit, soul and personality-state, and, through that
unity in you, the spirit will be connected with humanity,
with the world, in its hour of desperate need. From that
moment onwards, the lower nature will yield to the
governance of your renewed, true self. Then you will be
able to apply gnostic magic, for you will have become
capable — if we may put it in a somewhat old-fashioned

## 32— II The people will enter harmony

Imagine how it would be if there were a number of men and
women who had done what we described in the last chapter; a
group of people who, individually and as a group, had driven
a shaft, an unimpeded passage through all the main levels of
the etheric sphere. The result would be a tremendous opening
extending right into the domain where spirit, soul and matter
are united, a channel through which all the forces of blessed-
ness could flow into the material world.
However, it would not be possible to allow those currents
of sanctifying energy simply to act in a world like ours
without any modification, for they are so powerful that they
would turn into forces of judgment, forces that would act in a
destructive way, so that the world would very quickly perish
through fire. Because of the conditions prevailing in the
material sphere, and because reflection sphere forces have
such a grip on the world and humankind, no one could react
harmoniously to these enormously powerful vibrations in
their unmodified form.
So they have to be transmuted, and extended to humanity
in an organised way. That is why, before a group of servants
carries out its intention to influence humanity with the
merciful forces of salvation, it prepares a sanctuary, a
temple. Such a temple must fulfil certain necessary
conditions which enable it to serve as a basis for the work,
as a sanctified place in which the work of applying gnostic
magic can be carried out.
The possession of such temple-work places in which the
gnostic work could be performed was also the aim of those


```
THE PEOPLE WILL ENTER HARMONY
```
who stood behind the construction of many of the beautiful
and majestic cathedrals which have arisen in the course of the
centuries.
You may have realised by now that, by telling you about
this work, we are venturing onto completely new terrain, ter-
rain on which most pupils of our School have yet to set their
first, hesitant footsteps.
Until now, many pupils have seen the temple only as a
place where services are held, a place for meetings which
could be held elsewhere if the temple did not exist, or which
could just as well be listened to on a loudspeaker in another
room if the temple became too full. In other words, they are
seeing the temple from the protestant perspective, which
reduces the sanctuary's significance to a merely social level.
If you think this over, you will see that the development of
a School like ours is far from complete and that a great deal
of preparation still remains to be done. In this respect, banal
social habits and practices will not help any more than going
to the other extreme, and performing our religious
observances in the formal, liturgical way that has been tradi-
tional down the ages.
We need to undertake a practice which is founded on inner
quality and inner preparation. So we hope you have under-
stood the point we are trying to make, and are determined to
prepare yourself inwardly so that you can be ready as soon as
possible to carry out this holy temple work, for the time for it
has come. The temple work has become necessary. It will
have to be performed on an inner level, and it will emanate
from our temples as a new radiation-field that will span the
whole world with its beneficial effects.
What does this mean in terms of the tasks gnostic magic
has to fulfil Let us answer this question in the language of
Lao Tzu


```
THE PEOPLE WILL ENTER HARMONY
```
_If princes and kings were able to sustain it, the ten thousand
beings and things would yield to their governance. Heaven
and earth would unite and cause a gentle dew to fall, and the
people would enter harmony spontaneously, without needing
to be told._

Let us examine this task more closely. First of all we would
like to draw your attention to the term _ten thousand beings
and things._ For the ancient Chinese, this term was a way of
referring to the masses, to everyone living in this nature.
When the gnostic magic radiation-field becomes active hori-
zontally, spreading over the whole earth, the primary result
is that everything born in nature comes under its influence.
These king-priestly influences do not function in a
judging way but bring peace and tranquillity, because they
are radiations which have been received and transformed by
the priestly host. Their primary function is to disconnect the
material life-field from influences emanating from the
etheric spheres. This establishes a fresh basis for the masses
and their authorities, and the result is that they settle their
disputes, bridge gaping chasms and make the impossible
possible without needing to be told, without any form of
coercion or compulsion.
So that is how heaven and earth unite. If that were to hap-
pen, only a very isolated reflection sphere would remain, and
it would soon dwindle away quite naturally because of the
radiations of the higher nature released via the shaft formed
in the temples of the gnostic Brotherhood, which would cover
the earth as a `gentle dew'.
That would cause the conflicts between people, and be-
tween the higher nature and our life-field, to disappear of
their own accord. That is why the Gnosis and its servants
never need to involve themselves, for instance, in political


```
THE PEOPLE WILL ENTER HARMONY
```
disputes, or to pour out vials of criticism over the world and
humankind as the dialectical person tends to do.
So there is no need for you to criticise those who, in fact,
do not deserve it. For the masses live as they live and do
what they do because of the influences of the etheric sphere
which, owing to its magnetic nature, absorbs all humanity's
sins and then revivifies and reflects them back again, thus
causing a progressive degradation of human values and
standards of behaviour. And the authorities simply lead the
masses in a way which reflects their nature.
In this way the masses remain confined in a self-created
prison. It is their oppression that causes them to live by the
old testament law of `an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth'. Everyone jostles for the best positions, fierce disputes
rage and people keep on wounding each other with a
constant barrage of caustic criticism.
You should realise clearly that you do not need to follow
in the footsteps of the masses in order to help the world and
humankind. You do not need to declare yourself for or
against any activity; you do not need to declare yourself for
or against one nature-aeon or another.
You need only awaken your living soul through a worthy
and conscientiously practised new approach to life, so that
you can stand in the temple as a priestly human being. Then,
from the temple centre and the life-field surrounding you,
filled with the radiations of the higher nature, you will
unlock far-reaching new possibilities for countless people. In
this way you will be able to intervene quite impersonally in
all disputes; indeed, you will even be able to make wars
impossible and bring peace on earth.
In this way, through your actions as a new human being,
you will realise the divine will on earth, in the service of all
life-waves. As for the etheric spheres, they, too, will no


```
THE PEOPLE WILL ENTER HARMONY
```
longer be fed from the material life-field. Delusion will no
longer be able to gain a foothold and in this way the etheric
spheres will be cleansed in a completely natural way. De-
prived of their sources of nourishment, all delusional forms
will fade away like mist. All artificially fed nature-aeons will
have to adapt to the divine will and law, and they will change
entirely.
As a result, the character of dialectical nature will be
utterly transformed, and life will once more fulfil its purpose
in the unfoldment of the All. The earth will again become the
training school of eternity, and the deeper meaning of the
cycle of birth and death will be restored. In this way, the
whole of humanity as it exists at present will be realigned
with its destiny. And all this will have been achieved by the
practice of gnostic magic.
The great adversary knows this! It knows its hour has come,
and that is why a final struggle against everything belonging to
the darkness will be necessary. You need to understand the
term `struggle' in the right way. It means something quite
different from the kind of struggle known and applied in the
everyday world. It will be a struggle carried out by divine
Love, employing all the means it has been given in order to
help it gain the victory. It will be a victory in which all will
participate and to which there will be no end.
So we have introduced you to a task which is now begin-
ning to be carried out. It is a task which is being undertaken
by and for human beings, in keeping with the divine will and
law. When it is done, no one will be able to say `I did that',
for it will have been accomplished by the divine power of
blessedness, which is intended for everyone. He who can
understand, let him understand!



_He who knows others is astute, but he who knows himself is
illumined._

_He who overcomes others is strong, but he who overcomes
himself is omnipotent._

_He who can restrain himself is rich, but he who is filled with
energy has the power of will._

_He who does not deviate from his essential nature will live_

# 33 - I

## 33— I He who knows himself is illumined

Have you already found out how incredibly difficult it is to
know yourself If you think back over all your efforts in that
direction you will most likely conclude, heaving a sigh, that
`attaining self-knowledge is just not possible'. But self-
knowledge is essential, for it is the first step towards self-
improvement. So it is very sad to have to note that, despite
the ardent sincerity with which so many people strive for it,
their efforts yield such meagre results.
Indeed, the Bible speaks the truth when it says `He who
conquers himself is stronger than he who conquers a city', or,
to put it in Lao Tzu's words, _He who knows others is astute,
but he who knows himself is illumined._ Most people are quite
capable of observing what other people do and determining
the rights and wrongs of their behaviour; they are readily able
to distinguish what is futile, what is negative, and what is
hopelessly wide of the mark, because they are astute people
who are accustomed to pronouncing judgment on everything
and everyone, and telling their opinions to anyone who will
listen. For have they not seen it themselves Have they not
heard it and perceived it themselves People can tell you
everything about their fellow human beings, right down to the
smallest detail. But one should give no credence to these
opinions, because those who voice them are not able to
perceive the inner motives behind other people's actions or
words; at most, they are only able to guess at them.
For most people, the only way to form any conception of
self is to listen to what others say about them. A friend or
relation, for instance, could tell you quite plainly who you are


```
HE WHO KNOWS HIMSELF IS ILLUMINED
```
and what you are like, so plainly that in the end you believe
it. For surely your friends and relations are just stating the
facts What reason would they have to do otherwise But do
you realise how utterly misleading this kind of `self-
knowledge' is Your wife or husband, your brother, sister or
friend tells you, `That is how you are.' And eventually you
begin to believe it, and to attune your whole life, your whole
state of being, to the opinions of others. In the end, you will
even start believing that you are doing quite well in your
quest for self-knowledge.
If you can be sufficiently objective, you will realise that
there have been times when you, too, have been the victim of
this kind of situation. If you want a classic example of this,
think of Jesus the Lord, and other eminent workers and their
sublime servants, who were unable to have any effect in their
native surroundings, in their own birth-place, on their own
relatives. Think of the winged words `Can anything good
come out of Nazareth' `Surely nothing For we know him
too well.'
So even though your knowledge of human nature may
perhaps be useful in assessing other people, more often than
not your judgments are inaccurate, and involve many
misconceptions and miscalculations. If one realises this and
dares to acknowledge it, one has to accept that one is still
groping in the dark in one's quest for self- knowledge. As far
as knowing oneself is concerned, most people are either
much too optimistic or much too pessimistic, and not in the
least realistic.
`But why' you may ask. Well, because they possess no
sense-organ, no inner faculty, with which they could perceive
themselves and their behaviour objectively, and trace the
inner motives which gave rise to that behaviour, and the astral


```
HE WHO KNOWS HIMSELF IS ILLUMINED
```
forces behind them. For most people, the book of cause and
effect, the book of their own individual karma, is hermetically
sealed.
This also applies to occultists, even though they believe
themselves capable of discovering their own karmic state of
being. In the modern Spiritual School, occult methods —
which aim to penetrate the mysteries of existence with the
aid of the I-consciousness — are rejected.
The I-consciousness is capable of penetrating the mys-
teries of existence, but only to a certain extent, and the result
is always that it becomes very much more entrenched, with
an existence even more firmly bound and enmeshed in the
reflection sphere. Occultists unleash influences and forces
which they have learned to fear, and which they try to escape
or neutralise by means of certain tactics, by using their
ingenuity, but in the long term this is of course impossible.
An occult disposition, to the extent that it occurs among
our members, can be recognised, for instance, by the inability
or unwillingness to give up dependence on astrology, as a
method of investigating one's karma intellectually. The
horoscope is understood as a series of influences and radi-
ations that will have a good or bad effect on oneself and one's
interests. So the person with an occult disposition uses the
horoscope to gain a picture of the web in which he was
imprisoned at birth and — whilst remaining suspended in that
web — he tries to use his understanding of it to make things
as favourable and easy as possible for himself. Of the spider
that wove the web, and why, the horoscope tells nothing. So
astrology may conceivably provide the person with a means of
making life in nature somewhat more bearable, but not
necessarily. It may perhaps make the person rather more alert
to danger, and better able to benefit whenever new


```
HE WHO KNOWS HIMSELF IS ILLUMINED
```
dialectical possibilities arise. But for the rest it is only a stay
of execution, making the person neither better nor worse, but
only somewhat more astute.
As far as eternal salvation and true life are concerned, this
kind of astrology has nothing to offer. And because people
generally tend to become dependent on this science and to
understand it in an occult way, we have abandoned it totally.
As you may know, there was a time when we gave lessons in
astrology. For years we taught those gathered in the
Rosycross how to read the horoscope and draw up birth
charts. But we have said goodbye to all that, because only
when you seek the soul, and want to unravel the web of fate
for the sake of soul development, can an understanding of the
web in which you are currently enmeshed be of any use to
you, as an overview of the task facing you in your life as a
whole. But if you think that the information derived from
studying aspects is, in itself, self-knowledge, this can only be
detrimental to your progress.
The occultist has still more strings to his bow, such as the
tarot, the cabbala, and handreading. We, too, used these
things in our younger days but, since then, we have found
that the way to true self-knowledge is quite different.
It would be wonderful if you could realise this, for then
you could be spared a long road of experience, accompanied
by much trouble and sorrow. At the heart of all this is the
need for you to uncover a mystery, which consists of the
following steps
the first is knowing oneself, through which one attains
illumination;
the second is overcoming oneself, through which one be-
comes omnipotent;
the third is unlocking a new form of energy, through which
the magic faculty of the will is generated,


```
HE WHO KNOWS HIMSELF IS ILLUMINED
```
and the fourth is entry into the everlasting, new life, which
happens when the end of the journey through matter has been
reached.

You would do well to study this formula, and try to put it into
practice so that you can taste the fruits of it. It is a formula that
comes to you from the primordial past, bringing with it the
glory of infallibility. The question is, how does one attain self-
knowledge, and so become illumined And what does it mean
to be illumined
To find real answers to these questions, one needs to have
had a certain measure of experience; one needs to have drunk
from the bitter cup of suffering. For it is experience that
makes such questions well up in the human heart, questions
like `What is the purpose of my life What does it really
mean to be human What is the destiny of humankind'
If you do not ask these questions in an intellectual way, but
because you are driven by an inner need, because these
issues are really problems for you; if these questions well up
from the deepest depths of your being, then the urge to seek
will emerge in you of its own accord. It is an urge that will
be felt as a vital need, as a `to be or not to be'. Then, the
whole of the Universal Doctrine will open for you, the whole
of the divine plan for the world and humankind.
This process of seeking is made very much easier for
pupils, for all the literature of the School of the Rosycross is
available to them, and they study it, driven by a real inner
need. And because this urge to know is founded on an inner
need, the process of study is quite different from what is
ordinarily understood by the term.
This study leads to the discovery that the I-consciousness is
only a motoric activity whose function is to keep the persona-
lity alive and well, and that the personality is only a part of the


```
HE WHO KNOWS HIMSELF IS ILLUMINED
```
whole creation, intended to serve as the basis for
the development of the true human being.
Furthermore, one learns that the life of the
personality, as one knows it, is not life in the
ultimate sense of the word, which has to do with
the true human being, but is a purely animal
existence.
When the student understands that — and it will
be understood if he is motivated by an inner need
— a point of contact latent in the personality will
awaken and begin to bloom a point known as `the
rose of the heart'. From within the rose, a voice
will then begin to speak, the voice of the monadic
flame, which is the part of the higher human being
that must be connected with the lower human
being via the soul, as a result of which the
composition of the lower human being will be
changed and transfigured.
When the pupil begins to be inwardly aware of
that plan, when it opens up for him and is no longer
understood merely as an intellectual concept, he
will begin to live and grow in the direction intended
for him by the divine plan. That is what it means to
be illumined. Only then will there be knowledge of
the self, and knowledge of God. Then one really
knows that `the Kingdom of God is within you.'
So that is what illumination means. In the light
of that knowledge, the path of victory, the path of
self-conquest, can be walked.


# 33 - II

## 33— II He who overcomes himself is omnipotent

Now that the coming new day of manifestation is almost upon
us, we need adopt quite a new approach towards it, as we
have been explaining. Yet this new approach has very ancient
antecedents, for it dates back to the end of the Aries era, when
the message regarding it was first conveyed to slowly
maturing humanity. Then, throughout the Piscean era, this
same message was illustrated and exemplified by various
great forerunners and messengers. In the coming, new era, the
age of Aquarius, the message will have to be put into practice
by the whole of humanity. The mighty symbols of this
threefold process of transmitting, exemplifying and practising
are the Lamb, the Fishes, and the Waterbearer, who pours out
his pitcher of living water over all humankind.
So the time of fulfilment is almost upon us, and it _can_
come, it _can_ become a reality, because the necessary capa-
bilities now exist within the human being. More than four
thousand years have been given to human beings in which to
mobilise all these resources so now there is no reason why
pupils of the Spiritual School should not prepare themselves,
with joy and gratitude, for this magnificent task of liberation.
We have explained the first aspect of this process of self-
realisation in the terminology of the Tao Te Ching the
attainment of self-knowledge, through which one becomes
illumined. We would now like to go further, and discuss the
second aspect, which is overcoming the self, through which
one becomes omnipotent.

Once a human being has drunk deeply enough from the cup of


```
HE WHO OVERCOMES HIMSELF IS OMNIPOTENT
```
bitterness, and has eaten long enough from the fruit of the tree
of knowledge of good and evil, a new inner need develops, a
powerful urge to discover the purpose of his life, the plan that
lies at the foundation of his existence.
The more he understands of that plan, and the more his
desire, his heart, is fed with that understanding, the more his
heart becomes accessible to the light of the Gnosis. This is the
state of illumination, which opens the way to the miraculous
fulfilment. The rose begins to flower and the higher human
being, which encompasses the pupil as a microcosm, begins to
speak to him. In this way the candidate enters what we, along
with many of the ancients, refer to as the phase of mystical
illumination, of the nurturing of the plan touching him.
In that fundamental, new state of being which is now
emerging, the person's attitude to life will change; the stan-
dards by which he evaluates things will alter. Everything
which, until now, he considered important, will fade into
insignificance in the light of the new day, because a new
rational-moral faculty is being set free within him. We call it
`rational' as well as `moral' because, now that this change is
underway, the head sanctuary, as well as the heart sanctuary,
can begin to perform its true function again. So head and
heart, heart and head, work together in an illumined, rational-
moral state of being. Now the great work can begin. After
_knowing_ oneself, one must embark on the process of
_overcoming_ oneself. What does that mean
The human race is standing at the beginning of the age of
Aquarius, which means that the ages of Aries and Pisces now
lie behind it. This means that, since your microcosm takes on a
new personality once in every seven hundred years on
average, it has experienced around six lives in the last four
thousand years, and is now in its sixth or seventh life since the
beginning of the Aries era. So in the sense of your material


```
HE WHO OVERCOMES HIMSELF IS OMNIPOTENT
```
existence, you must already have received and experienced
the message about your vocation, far back in the past. Sub-
sequently, the way to follow that path of salvation must have
been illustrated and exemplified for you. That is why it is
time, now, for you to put that mighty task into practice.
What we mean to say is that, until now, the pupils of our
School have not fully utilised the countless opportunities for
liberation given them during past periods of existence.
Perhaps they even knew some of those great forerunners and
their servants personally, and heard them speak, but without
making any use of that opportunity. Perhaps, during their
last lifetime, it was the mighty movement of the Cathar
Gnosis that called them.
Throughout that whole series of past existences, they may
not yet have been mature enough to follow the path of victory,
and then they would have accumulated a great deal of karma,
which may have turned their astral strait-jacket into a prison so
confining that only now are they ready to walk the path of
victory. Or it is also possible that they are unable to advance
any further during this lifetime than the stage of mystical
illumination, as is the case with a great number of people.
But let us assume for the moment that you have been
through the phase of mystical illumination, and your heart
and head are now ready to follow the path of victory. Let us
assume that you are determined to follow that path —
because that is the most important thing! If only you are
willing to persevere, you will be able to accomplish
everything, for all the necessary abilities are present within
you. Then all you will need to do is make sure that your head
and heart remain in that new state of being. You will need to
keep your heart and head `in the light', as we often put it, and
not allow yourself to be handicapped by the grip of nature.
Then you will be able to accomplish the process.


HE WHO OVERCOMES HIMSELF IS OMNIPOTENT
If you keep your heart and head in the light, in that state of
illumination, this will create the optimal conditions for con-
necting the microcosm with the personality. The connecting
power, the uniting element, will then manifest the soul. In
other words, when the microcosm and the personality are
connected, the soul arises in between the two, as a new body.
For when the personality-system is kept in the light of the
Gnosis, its radiation is able to connect more and more
closely with that of the microcosm, and in this way, together,
they weave the living soul. That soul-body has an existence
which is _in_ the world, but no longer _of_ the world. So by
bringing the soul into existence, the human being is able to
enter the path of transfiguration.

This is a distinct phase which is entered once the process of
overcoming the self has been completed and the candidate
has therefore entered the state of omnipotence. What does it
mean to be omnipotent It is said that God is omnipotent. So
the Omnipotent One is God himself. So being omnipotent
means unlocking and participating in the core essence, the
nuclear power, of the Godhead.
This divine nuclear essence is present in every atom, and
corresponds to the fire, to the fifth ether. So when the candi-
date becomes able to control the fifth ether, the fire ether, this
means that he is able to control the nuclear essence of the
atom. It is that control which gives him omnipotence. Control
over the atom — that is omnipotence. It may sound strange to
put it this way, but it is as if every pupil who follows the path
in fact becomes an atomic reactor and applies nuclear fission.
Through the process we have been describing, the atoms from
which you are composed begin to manifest and radiate their
true nature, their inmost forces, and as a result,


```
HE WHO OVERCOMES HIMSELF IS OMNIPOTENT
```
that majestic transformation unfolds. Control over the atom
means omnipotence.
In the cave of the Grandmaster in the Sacred Mountain at
Ussat-les-Bains in France, there is a drawing of a celestial
ship, sketched in the style of ancient Egypt, with just a few,
simple lines. The ship's mast is a sevenfold cross, held
upright by a strong hand, so that an equally strong vertical
current of divine power can descend from the higher nature.
The horizontal beam of the cross opens out at each end into
three. One of these threefold end-points is supported by an
eagle, while the other is supported by the figure nine, the
mighty symbols of the divine fire and the divine power. So this
picture is a representation of the fact that, when the candidate
is able to liberate, assimilate and apply the fire ether, the Holy
Spirit, in the proper way, he will be carried along on the wave
of omnipotence. His celestial ship will be kept pointing
towards the one great aim with a firm hand. Through the
vertical — the horizontal. Through God — omnipotence.
Through the fire ether — liberation.
So the phase of mystical illumination must be followed by
unification, by coalescing with the flame, with the fire, with
the light, and through that, being united with God.
You know the term, `divine omnipresence', don't you
Well, that divine omnipresence, that divine power, is con-
tained in the fifth aspect of the atom. If the candidate opens
himself to that power, he becomes one with God. He is
united, right down to every atom of his being, with the core
essence of the All-Manifestation, and in this way the divine
power, omnipotence, becomes available to him.

Then the third aspect of the formula given to us by the Tao
Te Ching can follow unlocking this new energy, and thereby


```
HE WHO OVERCOMES HIMSELF IS OMNIPOTENT
```
developing the magical faculty of the will.
The will is the highest and greatest power a human being
can possess. That is why the will is called `the high priest'.
When, through the process of transfiguration, the lower
human being has merged with the higher human being, by
means of the soul, the will can function as a truly royal,
priestly faculty, because now it is linked with the fire of the
Godhead. Then it will be possible to draw a fiery cross, all-
encompassing and absolute, flowing vertically out of the
divine nature and spreading horizontally over the whole
world.
Now the thing you need to focus on is not how much pro-
gress you have made in that process, but how much you are
participating in it. The important thing is to make a start, to
join in. Then the strong will be able to help the weak, and a
unity will develop, the group unity we spoke about earlier.
Then we will no longer fulfil merely a calling, announcing
role in the world, for together, we will possess a power that
can actually bring about change. In this way, together, we
will build the Spiritual School as a mighty citadel amid the
turmoil of the times. Then, as a result of applying the new
power of volition, we will see the whole world, the whole of
humankind and the whole of our society change.


# 33 - III

# He who dies, yet is not lost,

# will enjoy everlasting life

We hope that, by now, you will have understood what Lao
Tzu was trying to say in chapter 33 of the Tao Te Ching. In a
few, powerful lines he sketched the entire formula for liber-
ation, so that his pupils could see the whole thing, as it were,
at one glance. We want to impress this sketch on you, so that
you will never again forget it. So, to conclude, we would like
to focus on the last aspect of the magical formula the com-
pletion of the work, the end of the journey through matter
entry into an everlasting, new life.

The human manifestation as we know it, the physical human
being living in the material world, is not the real, noble
human being intended by God, but constitutes the instrument
with whose help the great marvel of creation must be
achieved. To make that possible, the lower human being is
encompassed by the higher human being. However, the
ensouling factor, the igniting flame that would lead to `life' in
the true sense, is still lacking, for it has yet to be constructed
from basic principles. So all the resources necessary for that
construction process must be brought together and mobilised
so that, as a result of their functioning and their receptivity,
an exchange, an interaction of forces and radiations can come
about.
The result will be a life full of intense experiences. When
these experiences have been sufficiently etched into the
developing human being — and, alas, this is a process attended
by much sorrow and pain! — an acute longing begins to


```
HE WHO DIES, YET IS NOT LOST...
```
develop in the person concerned, a longing to know the real
purpose of life, and to be able to fulfil that purpose. The
result is that the person begins to seek, and love for the one
goal develops in his heart.
Eventually, the time comes when full understanding arises
in the head sanctuary. This allows the higher human being to
approach the lower human being much more closely, and a
mutual contact develops through which the radiant power of
the higher human being is able to illuminate the heart and
head of the lower human being. This radiant, fiery power,
which links and combines the higher and the lower, and
which can only be manifested when all the necessary require-
ments have been met, dissolves away what we call the `crys-
tallisation' or `gluten' factor in the lower human being.
The gluten factor is operative in the blood, among other
things, and when it is dissolved away, the result is the atomic
transformation we described to you earlier. This atomic
transformation makes the lower human being, the instrument,
receptive to the influx of the fire-ether. The lower human
being then becomes clothed in flames, wreathed in the Pent-
ecostal tongues of the fire ether, and in that state he attains
unity with the higher human being. The result is a new human
being, growing and developing day by day — through fire.
Then, amid the flames, the soul-being appears before the
inner eye, a being derived from light, from the fire of Vulcan,
clad in the raiment of kings, the Golden Wedding Mantle.
And the moment comes when it is no longer possible to say,
`Here is the lower human being, and there is the higher
human being,' for, by passing through the fire, spirit, soul and
body have been fused into one new being.
Once this work has been completed, and songs of victory
ring out, the candidate enters his true Fatherland. He casts off
his old material garment, now consumed to the last fibre, and


```
HE WHO DIES, YET IS NOT LOST...

from the ashes of his former dwelling the reality intended by
God arises; it ascends to the Throne of Thrones and enters the
everlasting life.
Those who mourn beside the lifeless heap of ashes have no
understanding of what a miracle has come about. But those
who do understand, they gaze upwards and see the Firebird,
the Phoenix, soaring up to heaven on broad wings, entering
through the opened portals. The new human being has come
home. The great, glorious work has been accomplished.
It is as Paul says in 1 Corinthians 3 `Each man's work will
become manifest. The Day will disclose it, because it will be
revealed with fire'. And Gustav Meyrink's words, too, come
true `We, who met in ages long past and have struggled
through the forces of darkness, may now greet the light,
through the liberating deed.'
Brothers and sisters, we are forging the lance. Encom-
passed by its radiance in our peaceful rooms, may the fire
mature within you. We who are linked in the Universal Chain,
we greet exultantly all those who have regained the victory.

```
Those who from delusion's grasp break free,
find the path to true reality.
Those who unto not-doing attain,
are linked as one, forever, in the Chain.
```
```
Amen.
